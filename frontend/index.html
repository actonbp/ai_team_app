        <h2>Task Instructions</h2>
        <p>Big Restaurant is a nationwide restaurant chain that specializes in traditional American food such as
            burgers, steaks, and pastas. Known for their family-friendly and casual atmosphere, they have over 500
            locations across the country. Because of recent successes, they are looking to expand by opening new
            restaurants.</p>
        <p>Your group will play the role of purchasing executives for Big Restaurant who are tasked with evaluating
            three locations that are being considered for a new restaurant opening; East Point Mall, Starlight Valley,
            and Cape James Beach. Your group's job is to rank these locations in order from most to least desirable.</p>
        <p>Big Restaurant wants your group to specifically focus on ten attributes, which they feel are most important
            in deciding the location to open a new restaurant. These attributes are: (1) at least 50 parking spaces, (2)
            larger than 2,000 square feet, (3) purchasing cost of less than $1MM, (4) no more than 2 direct competitors
            in vicinity, (5) substantial foot traffic, (6) low maintenance costs, (7) large tourist population, (8)
            large student population, (9) quick access to waste disposal, (10) large population of employable
            individuals.</p>
        <p>Please note that no attribute is more important than another, and all attributes should be treated equally.
            The most desirable location is the one that fulfills the largest total number of attributes (criteria).</p>
        <p>Each member of the group has been provided with a list of attributes (criteria) that are satisfied by each
            location. Please note that each group member's list is different. Your list may not be complete (i.e.
            include blanks), and another group member may have information missing from your list. There are no
            inconsistencies or contradictions between lists. You may tell others information from your list, but please
            do not directly copy and paste, share, or display your list to other group members during the chat.</p>
        <p>As mentioned above, your group's goal is to rank the three locations in order of most attributes met (i.e.
            the highest ranked location will meet the most criteria, second-highest location will meet the second-most
            criteria, etc.). You will have 15 minutes to complete the task. Good luck!</p>
