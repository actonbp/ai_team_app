Ebony: Hey team, Ebony here! I see cool guy just joined the chat. Welcome to the team! Should we all first introduce ourselves and explain our badge name like the task directions said?
Maurice: Hey team! Iâ€™m Maurice and they call me the Master of Motivation ðŸ˜„ Iâ€™m here to keep the energy up and make sure we find the best spot for our new restaurant! Letâ€™s dive into these locations and check 'em out!

Starting with East Point Mall, we're looking good on parking, foot traffic, student population, waste disposal, and employability but it's a bit smaller than we might want and not many tourists around.

Starlight Valley, scores on parking and waste disposal, but thatâ€™s about it. Itâ€™s missing on student population and employability.
  
Cape James Beach, mixed bag here! No parking, but it's good on avoiding competitors and appealing to tourists, yet no quick waste disposal.

Thoughts? How do we feel about these starting points? ðŸ˜Š
Maurice: Looks like I went a bit over the top there ðŸ˜… Alright, keeping it short!

East Point Mall's got a lot covered except space and tourists. Starlight Valley's a bit weak on student crowd and workers. Cape James Beach, no parking, but great for tourists and less competition.

Ebony, Trevon, Bryan, what do you think? Any prefs based on this info?
