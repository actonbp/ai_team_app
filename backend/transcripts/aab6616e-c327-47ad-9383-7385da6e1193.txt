Maurice: Hey team, Maurice here- I see Cool Guy just joined the chat. Welcome to the team.. Should we all first introduce ourselves and explain our badge name like the task directions said?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Maurice: Hey team! Just a heads up, I'm Maurice, the Master of Motivation here to keep the vibes high and get this sorted. Let's dive into the location details. Starting with East Point Mall - it's got good foot traffic, lots of potential employees, and quick waste disposal but is a bit small on size and not big on tourists. What do you guys think?
Ebony: Hey Maurice! Ebony here, also known as Strategist Supreme, cuz I'm all about mapping out plans efficiently. About East Point Mall, totally agree on the pros. Only thing is it misses on cheaper purchasing cost and tourists. How do these factors weigh in for you or anyone else?
Trevon: Hey all, Trevon here. FYI, they call me the Logic Luminary 'cause I'm all about the numbers and straight facts, no fluff. ðŸ’¡

On East Point Mall, yep good spot for employees and traffic, but lacking in tourist draw. Starlight Valley has low competitors and good cost but poor on student and job scene. Cape James seems solid on traffic, maintenance, and tourists. Thoughts?
Ebony: Yeah Trevon, got it. Adding on, Cape James doesn't have the parking sorted, which could be a bit of a problem. Starlight Valley needs more work on the employment pool. Each spot's got a mix of perks and downers.
