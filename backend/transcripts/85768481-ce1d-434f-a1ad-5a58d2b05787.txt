Ebony: Hey team, it's Ebony here! So about my badge name, Strategist Supreme, I see it as being all about coming up with detailed plans and strategies that help us nail our objectives. Looking forward to putting our heads together on this one!

Diving right in, East Point Mall looks good for its foot traffic, student population, access to waste disposal, and employable individuals, but it misses the mark on purchase cost and tourist draw. What does everyone else think?
Trevon: Trevon here. Logic Luminary means I'm all about cutting through the fluff with sharp analysis. Let's keep things straight to the point.

Ebony, gotta disagree on East Point Mall lacking a tourist draw. That factor's not as critical given its other strengths like foot traffic and student pop. Let's not overemphasize one missing piece. What about Starlight Valley and Cape James? Lack of employable individuals at Starlight is a big red flag.
Trevon: Maurice, let's not jump the gun on Cape James. Lack of specifics on parking & waste disposal here doesn't mean it's all bad. Plus, tourist attraction is highâ€”a major plus. We need all facts on table before ditching options. Bryan, anything to add on these points?
Maurice: Hey all, Maurice here! As the Master of Motivation, I'm all about keeping the energy up and pushing us toward our goal. Let's crush this!

For Starlight Valley, not looking gr8 with employable peeps missing. Could be a dealbreaker? And if we're hitting each criterion, Cape James's lack of parking & waste disposal could hurt. Thoughts, Bryan?
Ebony: Maurice and Trevon, got your points on Cape James. It's got its own plus side with the tourist draw and the competitive aspect. Maybe the parking and waste disposal issues could be manageable with the right planning? 

For East Point and Starlight Valley, we're seeing trade-offs between student pop and tourist attraction, and employability issues at Starlight. Seems like no spot's perfect. Bryan, any insights on these, especially on how critical the parking and waste issues are at Cape James?
