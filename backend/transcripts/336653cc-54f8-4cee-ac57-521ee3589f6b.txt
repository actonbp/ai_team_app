Trevon: Trevon is typing...
Trevon: Hey team, Trevon here- I see we are all here. Welcome.. Maybe we should all introduce ourselves and then jump into the task?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Trevon: Yeah, East Point seems solid for parking & foot traffic. But tourist and maintenance not so great :/
Maurice: Hey Ebony, what's your take on East Point Mall? Seems solid with parking and traffic.
Trevon: Yep, agree on East Point for the worker availability and foot traffic. No good for tourists tho, like y'all said.
Maurice: Yeah, Ebony, East Point's got good foot traffic and a decent workforce pool. Not so glam for tourists though.
Trevon: Yeah the waste disposal at East Point is solid. Cape James though, how's it looking for the same, Ebony?
Maurice: Agree on the worker availability, Trevon. Also, East Point scores well for waste disposal. Could be a plus!
Trevon: Hey Ebony, yeah East Pointâ€™s got the basics down with parking and workers. Not a hotspot for tourists, right?
Maurice: Got it Bryan, East Point's cool for parks & work stuff, lacks tourist vibe. Howâ€™s the rest looking for Starlight or Cape James?
Trevon: Yep Maurice, East Point's solid on parking & crowd. Weak on tourists, tho.
Maurice: East Point's got good parking, foot traffic, and waste disposal. Not big on tourists though. How's Cape James on those, Bryan?
Maurice: Right, Bryan, East Pointâ€™s got the basics down but skips on the tourist appeal.
Trevon: Sup, I'm Trevon. Got the deets on East Point. Good for parking, foot traffic, workers, and waste, but not hot for tourists or maintenance. What's the skinny on Cape James and Starlight from you guys?
Maurice: lol, Trevon, right? East Point's okay, still busy enough. Whatâ€™s up w/ Starlight and Cape James tho?
Trevon: Whoops, didn't mean to paste that ðŸ˜…. Yeah, so East Point's got good foot traffic and stuff, just not touristy. How's Cape James looking for the rest, anyone checked?
Ebony: East Point's doing good on parking, workers, and trash stuff. Tourist scene's not popping though. What's up with Starlight and Cape James? Haven't looked much into those.
Trevon: Don't know much bout Cape James, but seems it ticks some good boxes. How's it for students and workers?
Maurice: East Point's alright - workers, traffic, trash all good. Cape James tho, not so sure. No parking and guess what, not good for waste either, Bryan.
Trevon: East Point's parking, foot traffic, and workers are solid, but tourist and repair costs could be better. Cape James got better foot traffic and tourist vibes though.
Maurice: Hey Bryan, heard East Point has places for cars and good foot traffic, but nothing for tourists really. Looks like it gets a mix, huh?
Trevon: Looks like Cape James might be pulling ahead with the tourist and maintenance perks. How's everyone feeling about Starlight Valley?
Maurice: East Pointâ€™s solid for parking, good foot traffic. Cape James has tourist vibe but parking's a mess. Starlight? Meh, not sure yet.
Trevon: East Point's okay for parking, foot traffic, waste disposal. No tourist buzz. Cape James has foot traffic and tourists. Still iffy on Starlight. Thoughts, Maurice?
Maurice: East point's cool for parking, workers, getting rid of trash, but no tourists really. Cape James hit or miss on parking, but gets tourists. Starlightâ€™s kinda eh, right? Whatâ€™s the vibe there, Bryan?
Trevon: East Point's decent for parking, students, workers, and waste stuff. But nah for tourists & upkeep. How's Starlight Valley & Cape James on those, anyone?
Maurice: Got it, East Pointâ€™s decent on parking, workforce, and trash. Cape James better for tourists. Starlight, still need info. What's the vibe at Starlight, Bryan?
Trevon: Missed your name, Maurice. East Point's solid for parking & jobs but weak on tourists. How about Cape James' traffic & upkeep stats? Anyone?
Maurice: Hey Bryan, Cape James is good for tourists, but parking and waste disposal are issues. Starlight's kinda average, good for parking and waste but low on manpower and students. What y'all think?
