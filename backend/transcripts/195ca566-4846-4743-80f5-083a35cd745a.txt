Ethan: Hey team, Ethan here. Got some insights. East Point Mall seems decent, good traffic & student pop, but forget about low maintenance and tourists. Starlight Valley? Cheap, but no workforce. Cape James sounds like a tourism goldmine with low upkeep. Thoughts?
James: Hey team, James here! 👋 Quick dive in - EPM's got traffic, students & easy trash but small size. StarValley? Parking ✔️, but no students or big workforce. Cape James? Tourist 👑 but parking & trash issues. Seems like each spot's a mixed bag. No clear winner yet, huh?
Sophia: Hey Ethan, Sophia here! Totally get your points. From what I've seen, East Point Mall has solid foot traffic and a good student crowd, plus easy waste disposal, but yep, it's not cheap. Starlight Valley is strong on space and tourists but lacking in workforce. Cape James seems tight on parking but is strong on affordability and tourists. It's a mix! What criteria are we leaning toward as top priorities?
Sophia: Yeah, James, it’s reminding me of a jigsaw puzzle where no piece fits perfectly. Let's maybe do a quick headcount of "yes"s for each spot against our criteria? Might give us a clearer picture 🧐 What do you think, Bryan?
undefined (Bryan): Hi All I am "Cool Guy" since I am cool under pressure. We should remember the directions said that all criteria are equally weighted. Let's thus do some strategy like count the yes's at each location?
