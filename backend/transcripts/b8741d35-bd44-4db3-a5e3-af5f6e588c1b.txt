James: Hey team! James here, aka Master of Motivation ðŸ˜Ž My badge basically means I'm here to keep us focused and energized! Let's nail this ranking. What's everyone thinking so far? Bryan, any initial thoughts on these locations?
Sophia: Hey all! Sophia here, your Strategist Supreme ðŸ˜Š My badge means I'm here to help us sort through details and come up with a solid game plan.

James, energized to work with you! Bryan, looking forward to hearing your thoughts. How about we start by evaluating each location against our criteria? Got my insights ready!
Sophia: Absolutely, James! East Point Mall does seem like a strong contender with its benefits. The size might be a downside, but its perks like high foot traffic and a large student pop might balance it out. 

Bryan, what do u think? Does the size concern you, or do the positives outweight it?
James: Love the strategy, Sophia! Let's dive into East Point Mall first. It checks off a lot of boxes: parking, foot traffic, student population, waste disposal, employable folks. Only miss is size. Thoughts? Bryan, does this sound like a strong contender to you?
James: Waiting to hear ur thoughts, Bryan! Size aside, East Point Mall seems solid. What's ur take?
Sophia: While we wait for Bryan, maybe we can discuss Starlight Valley next? It's big enough, has foot traffic, and tourists but lacks a large student and employable pop. Could be tricky for staffing? 

James, what do you think? Can the tourist flow make up for the staffing issue?
