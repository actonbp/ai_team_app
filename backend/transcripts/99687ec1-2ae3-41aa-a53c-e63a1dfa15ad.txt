Maurice: Hey Trevon, Maurice here. East Point too small, but ticks most boxes. Pros and cons! What‚Äôs the word, Ebony, Bryan?
Trevon: Pros def outweigh the cons for East Point. Sm size might not be a dealbreaker? What abt Starlight Valley and Cape James Beach? Any info, Ebony or Bryan?
Ebony: Hey Maurice, Trevon,

Ebony here - for my 1st message gotta explain the badge name, then we good 2 go. Starlight Valley's big, loads of ppl n tourists but lacks students/ workers. Cape James cool for price, no parking, busy spot, tourists everywhere.

Ebony: Cape James - solid, no parking, high traffic, good vs competitors, tourists. Ranking? Thoughts?
Maurice: Bryan, Cape James busy & touristy, no parking, waste prob. Starlight Valley, okay parking, no students or lots workers. That's it. üëç

East Point better? Fewer probs. Thoughts, Bryan?
