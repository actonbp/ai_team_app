Ethan: Hey team, I'm Ethan. Look, I'm not one for fluff, so let's dive in. Based on what I see, East Point Mall seems solid, lots of yeses, except low maintenance and tourists. Starlight Valley's lacking in workforce and student vibes, and Cape James? Tourist hotspot with little hassle. Thoughts? Bryan, James, Sophia, chime in.
Ethan: Sophia, you got any input on maintenance costs? East Point's a miss there. And Bryan, tourist draw big at Cape James, but is it enough? East Point seems ahead, even with its drawbacks. Starlight? Meh, unless we wanna gamble on buying cheap. Let's not get stuck on one spot tho. Thoughts?
James: Ethan's got a point. East Point's lack of space might be a downer but hits most boxes. Starlight's missing student and employment vibe. Cape James, tourists and no rivals sound great, but parking and waste disposal? Ugh. Might lean toward East Point for balance. Bryan, Sophia, weigh in?
