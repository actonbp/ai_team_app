Ebony: Hey team, Ebony here. Just a heads up on the "Strategist Supreme" badge—it's about being sharp at planning the best moves pretty much.
Ebony: Quick into looking at what we got:

East Point Mall scores well on several fronts like foot traffic & availability of employees but misses on
Ebony: purchasing cost & a large tourist population. What does everyone else think?...
Ebony: Hey Trevon, Maurice,
Cape James:
- cheaper, tourists :)
- parking sucks
Starlight Valley:
- lots tourists
- not enough workers 
How we ranking em?

Trevon: Cape James tops, got tourists & cheap, parking's a pain though. Starlight Valley's missing workers, so a no-go. East Point’s decent, mixed but solid. Stick with Cape James?
Trevon: Cape James #1, cheap + tourists, parking bad. East Point #2, got workers & traffic. Starlight no good, no workers.
Trevon: Cool with that?

Ebony: Cape James #1, cheap, lots tourists. East Point #2, good traffic & enough workers. Skip Starlight, looks nice but not practical. We cool? 

Ebony🔍
Maurice: Sounds good! Cape James #1, East Point #2. Agree with skipping Starlight. 👍👍
Cool with everyone?
Trevon: Cape James #1, solid pick, tons of tourists & low upkeep. East Point #2, got parking & good foot traffic but costs high & not much tourists. Starlight’s a no-go, low workforce & students. We good?

Trevon🔍 (cuz I crack the numbers)
Maurice: Yep, Cape James #1, East Point #2. No Starlight. We good!
