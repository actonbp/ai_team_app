James: Hey team, James here- I see Cool guy just joined the chat. Welcome to the team.. Should we all first introduce ourselves and explain our badge name like the task directions said?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Sophia: Hey team, I’m Sophia! Quick rundown on locations based on the criteria:
- East Point Mall had most positives, like parking, foot traffic, waste disposal, and student population.
- Starlight Valley's got size going for it and good foot traffic too.
- Cape James Beach lacks parking but is good on cost, competitors, and tourists.

What’s everyone else's info looking like?
Ethan: Hey team, just jumping in. I'm Ethan, focusing on getting these location rankings sorted without too much hassle. Here’s a quick breakdown from my side:

- East Point Mall looks good on paper with high scores on parking, foot traffic, and employable population but isn't great on maintenance costs or tourism.

- Starlight Valley is shaky, good on cost and competition, but lacks a student body and workforce.

- Cape James Beach nailing it with traffic, low costs, and tourism vibes.

Thoughts? How do these stack up against the other info you guys have?

Sophia: Yeah Ethan, looks like we're seeing similar stuff. East Point Mall got lots of Yeses but a couple of big Nos make it tricky. 

Starlight Valley’s missing out on people resources, looks like.

Cape James, despite the parking issue, ticks a lot of boxes, espc with costs and tourist appeal. 

Bryan, got any insights on these? What do you think?
Sophia: James, any insights on your end? How are the locations looking from your perspective?
