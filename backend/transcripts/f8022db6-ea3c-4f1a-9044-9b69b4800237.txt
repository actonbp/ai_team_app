Sophia: Hey team, quick rundown on my findings: East Point Mall looks solid with 5 yeses like good foot traffic and student pop. Starlight Valley is great for tourists and got space, but lacks on the employee side. Cape James vibes with less competition and good foot traffic, though no parking. Thoughts? How are the other places stacking up?
James: Hey team, quick recap on my badge, Master of Motivationâ€”just means I'm here to keep things moving and upbeat!ðŸš€

Looking at these locations, East Point Mall seems solid with 5 Yesâ€™s. Good foot traffic and lots of potential workers. Starlight Valley's kinda meh, only 2 yesâ€™s...might be troublesome. Cape James Beach is alright I guess, balanced but no parking plus waste disposal issues could be a pain. Thoughts?
