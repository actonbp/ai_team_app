Maurice: Hey team, Maurice here aka Master of Motivation! Let's nail this. Got some key insights:
- East Point Mall's looking good with parking, foot traffic, student crowd, waste access, and employable folks. Only snag, it's cozy size-wise.
- Starlight Valley's a mixed bag, got parking and waste access but misses on students and workforce.
- Cape James Beach, no worries on space or competition, plus tourists! Parking and waste access? Not so much, and fewer students and workforce.
Thoughts? Bryan, what's your take?
