Ethan: Hey James, East Point Mall looking pretty good with lots of yes's like foot traffic and parking. Cape James has zeros nos tho, solid for tourists and maintenance. Thoughts?
Ethan: Bryan, East Point has high foot traffic which is a big plus, but itâ€™s not great on maintenance costs or tourist numbers. Still decent tbh. Just tossing that out there.
James: Sophia, gotcha on East Point. Yeah, foot traffic's great, parking's solid too. No big on size tho, and not tons of tourists.bethesda-mail
