undefined (Bryan): Hello Team!
Ethan: Looks like I jumped into the convo a bit late. Hey everyone, Ethan here. Just caught up. Bryan, what's ur take on these locations?
Sophia: Hey team, Sophia here! Has everyone had a chance to look over the criteria for East Point Mall, Starlight Valley, and Cape James Beach? What're your initial thoughts on these? ðŸ¤”
Ethan: Bryan, think ur missing the point. Cape James is all about tourists but doesn't hit our size or budget needs. Right?
Sophia: Hey Bryan! Looking at the criteria, East Point Mall & Cape James Beach seem promising. East Point has lots of foot traffic but is over budget. Thoughts?
James: Hey Bryan, Sophia & Ethan! James here. East Point hits most of our needs but size ðŸ˜…. Starlight Valley low on manpower? Cape James, parking issue huh?
Ethan: Bryan, think everything's too rosy with Starlight Valley. No manpower & it's small, no? How we gonna run a busy restaurant there?
Sophia: Right, considering what you guys said, East Point's cost and Cape James's size and parking probs could be tough. How does Starlight stack up? Adjust for its cons?
Sophia: Bryan, given your thoughts, seems like Cape James is almost perfect except for the parking and size issue. Maybe there's a workaround? Thoughts?
Ethan: Bryan, are you even considering the logistics? Cape James literally fails on crucial points like size and parking. How do you overlook that? ðŸ˜’
Sophia: So, looking back, Cape James has a lot going for it minus the parking and size. Could we consider nearby parking solutions or leasing spaces? ðŸ¤” Bryan, any thoughts on that?
Ethan: Bryan, you're missing the obvious flaws in Cape James. Plus, how are you planning to sidestep the whole size and parking debacle there? It's not just about 'workarounds'.
James: James is typing...
