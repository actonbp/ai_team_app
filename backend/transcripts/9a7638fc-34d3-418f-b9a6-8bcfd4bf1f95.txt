Ethan: East Point Mall is too small, and those maintenance costs? Big issue. Plus, no tourists. Not ideal. Thoughts?
James: Hey team, James here! Ready to dive into these locations. Thoughts on East Point Mall not being over 2000 sqft? Seems tight for a big restuarant.
Sophia: Hey James! Yeah, East Point Mall's size sounds a bit restrictive for a Big Restaurant. But it ticks other boxes like parking and foot traffic. Worth weighing pros and cons? ü§î
Sophia: Definitely agree on the size and maintenance issues at East Point Mall. The lack of tourists is also a con. But it has good foot traffic and a young demographic. Could be a mixed bag. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[object HTMLSpanElement] (bryan): Shouldn't we instead try to count all of the Yes's and take a step back here?
Sophia: That's a great point! Let's do a quick tally. Looks like East Point Mall has 6 Ys, Starlight Valley has 4, and Cape James Beach also has 5. Based on this, how should we rank them?
Ethan: Hey, it's Ethan. Looks like Cape James Beach is killing it with foot traffic, low maintenance, and tourists. How's it on other criteria? ü§®
Sophia: Right, Starlight Valley does check some important boxes like size, tourists, and foot traffic. But lacking student and employable populations could be tricky for staffing and daily customer base. ü§î
James: So, looking at what we've gathered, Starlight Valley might struggle without a large student or employable population, huh? Plus, no mention of tourists or foot traffic... Thoughts? üßê
Ethan: Agreed, James. Despite East Point's size and maintenance issues, it leads with a 6 against Cape James's strong tourist and foot traffic appeal. Starlight Valley does fall behind. Priorities clear?
James: So, with that extra detail, it feels like East Point Mall might edge out a bit ahead despite its flaws. Cape James then follows with strong tourists and employable pop. Starlight Valley seems last? Thoughts?
James: James is typing...
