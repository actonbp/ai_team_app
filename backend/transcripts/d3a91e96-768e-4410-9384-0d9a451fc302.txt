James: Hey team, James here! ðŸŒŸ Just a heads up, I'll be dropping some quick insights like a chef sprinkles salt, so get ready. My badge? It's "Speedy Insights" cos Iâ€™m all about those fast, snappy updates. What's up, Bryan? Got any tasty info on these locations? Let's get this discussion rollin'! ðŸš€
James: So, guys, East Point Mall sounds promising with good foot traffic and student pop. Downside? Space is < 2000 sqft. Thoughts? Bryan?
Ethan: Hey, James, Ethan here. My badge? "Direct Disputant". Expect me to challenge everything. Less than 2k sqft at East Point Mall? That's a no-go. We need space, right? Bryan, thoughts?
Ethan: Actually, James, gotta disagree. East Point got thr issues but space isn't on my list. Where'd ya get that info? ðŸ¤” Bryan, got any deets on space there?
Sophia: Hey guys, Sophia here! My badge is "Detail Dispatcher", so I'm here to supply those in-depth plans with quick, friendly updates. I checked, and there's no size issue with East Point Mall on my end, James. It actually checks off a lot of our criteria but didn't hit on low purchasing cost. Bryan, Ethan, what are your thoughts on the importance of space vs cost?
