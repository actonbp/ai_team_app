James: Hey team, James here- I see we are all here. Welcome.. Maybe we should all introduce ourselves and then jump into the task?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Ethan: 1/2: Hey team, Ethan here. Just looked over the stats for the locations. East Point Mall looks solid with big yes on parking and foot traffic. Starlight Valley's missing marks on student and employment numbers. Cape James has good traffic and low costs.
Ethan: 2/2: Thoughts?
Sophia: 1/2: Hey Ethan, good points! Adding on, East Point Mall has a big N on the purchase cost being under $1MM, but yeah, it‚Äôs solid on the other fronts like parking and student pop. Cape James is missing the parking but strong on cost and competitors.
Sophia: 2/2: Tough call!
James: East Point: 5 Y‚Äôs, parking + foot traffic solid, good for students + jobs.üëç Cape James & Starlight?
Sophia: Starlight Valley weak on student pop and people to hire. Has good size, foot traffic, and tourists though. Cape James misses on parking but scores well in other spots. Tough to balance!
Sophia: Gotcha, so looks like Cape James is weaker on parking but good on cost and competition. Maybe ranks higher than we think? What's everyone's take on importance of parking vs cost?
Ethan: Parking matters. More spots, more customers. Bryan?
Sophia: True, parking does pull in more folks. But also, East Point's high foot traffic and student presence could offset parking needs somewhat. What do ya think, James and Ethan?
Sophia: I'm leaning towards bigger weight on foot traffic and local attractions tbh. East Point Mall looks good for that, even without the cost efficiency. James, you think this could balance out the higher costs?
Sophia: East Point costs high, good foot traffic/student pop tho. Cape James cheaper, lacks parking. Opinions? James?
James: Yeah Ethan, the balance at East Point might work in our favor. Big yes on student traffic and jobs. Foot traffic is a win too. Could make up for the high costs?
Sophia: East Point: Lots of students & workers, cost high. 
Cape James & Starlight: got perks too.
James: Bingo, Sophia! Cons on East Point are there but big yeses balance that out. Foot traffic + student crowd? Wins in my book! üòÑ Bryan, any takes on Cape James vs Starlight?
undefined (Bryan): What do you guys think in terms of rank? Give me a long answer for your logic
Sophia: James, if we think about it, Cape James‚Äôs lack of parking might be offset by its low cost, tourist draw, and lack of competitors. Could pull in good business during the tourist seasons. What do you guys think about giving it a higher rank due to these benefits?
Sophia: Bryan, keeping it quick: 

1. East Point - Students + jobs, pricy tho.
2. Cape James - Cheap, touristy.
3. Starlight - Less jobs & students.

Clear enough?
James: Sounds good to me. Ethan, Sophia, we good with this ranking?

1. East Point Mall
