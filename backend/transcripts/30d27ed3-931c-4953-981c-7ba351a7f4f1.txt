James: Hey team, James here, aka Master of Motivation! My role? Keeping us all on track and reminding us to share info for the best decision. Let's nail this! What's everyone's take so far? ðŸš€ Bryan, got any insights to kick things off?
Sophia: Hey everyone, Sophia here, thrilled to be part of the team! My badge, Strategist Supreme, means I'm all about diving deep into the details and crafting plans that guide us to success. Let's kick things off! Bryan, James, any priorities you're looking at for these locations?
James: Sophia, focusing on 3 things: foot traffic, student pop, and parking. East Point Mall ticks these boxes well, esp for students. Thoughts on this? Bryan, weigh in?
James: Totally, Sophia! East Point Mall looks promising. ðŸš€ Got an eye on Cape James too for the tourist vibe but lacks parking & disposal ease. Bryan, got a fave yet?
James: Looks like Cape James lacks in a few key areas, esp parking & waste disposal. Could be a deal-breaker for some customers. ðŸ¤” Bryan, thoughts on the importance of waste disposal for us?
James: Good point! Disposal isn't just about being neat; it's also about staying eco-friendly & cost-effective. East Point's got the edge on this. ðŸŒ± Bryan, do eco factors play a big role for you?
