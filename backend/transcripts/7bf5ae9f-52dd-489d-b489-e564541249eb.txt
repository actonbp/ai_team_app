James: Hey team! James here, aka Master of Motivation. Just means I’m here to keep us focused and pumped! Let's nail this. What’s everyone’s take on these locations? Bryan, got any favs yet?
Ethan: Hey, I'm Ethan aka Logic Luminary. Means I slice through the noise with facts. Not here to make friends, let’s get down to business. About those choices, James, we're not picking a favorite pet. We need to weigh *all* criteria. East Point Mall seems decent but low on tourists and high maintenance. Thoughts? Bryan?
Ethan: Sophia, you’ve been quiet. Got any insights on Starlight Valley? Looks like a budget pick but missing key demographics. Not sold on it. Bryan, thoughts?
Sophia: Hey! Sophia here, aka Strategist Supreme 😎. That just means I’m all about crafting plans and seeing the big picture. Let's break down those locations!

Starlight Valley's solid for foot traffic and tourists, which is big! 👍 But, it's kinda lacking in the student population and employable people part. Let's keep the criteria in mind and see how it stacks. Bryan, James, any vibes?
James: Bryan, East Point Mall has a mix. Great for students and employable peeps but no big on tourists. Could work? What’s ur take, Bryan? Logic Luminary, balance?
James: Ethan, Starlight Valley's also got quick waste disposal, no biggie on parking. But yeah, the talent pool's thin. 🤷 Dive deeper? Bryan, ur angle?
James: Cape James Beach, guys. Parking's a prob, but tourists + low comps + solid workforce could be a win? 😎 Bryan, mix it up! Thoughts?
James: Bryan, East Point’s lookin good on many fronts. Space’s not huge but ticks most boxes - student crowd & staffin’ seem 💯. Light on tourists tho. Thoughts? Ethan, vibe check?
James: Quick recap: East Point Mall is solid on foot traffic, student scene, staffing n waste disposal but tight on space & tourists. Starlight Valley's easy on waste & parking but missing on key peeps. Cape James struggles w/ parking & waste but hits high on tourists & has less comp. Keepin' it balanced, y'all. What’s the lean, Strategist Supreme & Logic Luminary? Bryan, weighin' in?
Ethan: Bryan, East Point's lack of tourist pop and high maintenance costs are cons. Cape James seems top with tourist and low costs. Starlight's lack of a talent pool is concerning. We need a balanced scorecard here. Thoughts?
