Kicking off with East Point Mall - we’re looking good on parking, foot traffic, student presence, waste disposal, and a solid pool for hiring. 👥🚗 But, it’s not huge on space. Thoughts? Bryan, got a take on this?
Ebony: Hey Maurice! Ebony here, aka the Strategist Supreme. The title? It's about crafting winning plans with attention to detail. 📊 Ready to dive into the location deets with you all.

Expanding on East Point Mall, gotta point out, it's missing the mark on tourist appeal and doesn't meet the space criteria. It does check off a lot of boxes though. Thoughts on importance of tourist traffic vs student crowd? Bryan, Maurice, what's your take?
Maurice: Ebony, you’re spot on. Tourist traffic vs. student crowd is a tricky balance. 🤔 I’d say, given our strong student pop at East Point Mall, it's a solid base. Tourists are great but less reliable year-round, ya know? Students = steady flow. Bryan, Ebony, thinking this might edge out as a plus for East Point?
Maurice: Moving onto Starlight Valley, folks. We've got parking and waste disposal sorted, but it's not looking strong on student crowd or workforce. 🚶‍♂️👩‍🎓 Might be a bit of a challenge there. How do we feel about its potential without much student engagement? Bryan, Ebony, does that sound like a dealbreaker to you?
Maurice: Hey team, Maurice here! I see Cool Guy just joined the chat. Welcome to the team! Should we all first introduce ourselves and explain our badge name like the task directions said?
