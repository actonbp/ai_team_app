James: Hey Ethan! Good point about East Point Mall's maintenance costs. It's tricky without more detail. Maybe higher due to the mall setting? Could impact our long-term costs significantly. What's everyone else’s take on this? Sophia, any insights or concerns on your end? ⭐
Ethan: ETHAN here. 🙄 Sophia, foot traffic & student population are fine but overlooking maintenance costs at East Point Mall? Rookie move. Plus no tourists? Big oversight. Let's not get too cozy with just one aspect. Thoughts, folks? ⭐
James: Hey team! James here. 🙌 Just digested the info on our potential locations. Thoughts on East Point Mall having substantial foot traffic but missing out on that tourist boost? Could be a biggie. ⭐
Sophia: Hey James!👋 Sophia here. Totally see your point on East Point Mall missing that tourist angle. The high foot traffic & student population could still make it a solid choice for consistent business though, don't you think? What's everyone else's take on this? ⭐
Sophia: Hey James, Ethan! 😊 For East Point Mall, higher maintenance might indeed come from being in a mall setting - more foot traffic, higher wear and tear, plus potential for mall fees. It's centrally located, which is great for accessibility and the labor pool, like Ethan mentioned. But, the absence of a large tourist population and the high purchasing cost are concerning to me. What do you guys think? 

Also curious about Starlight Valley and Cape James Beach given these points. Starlight seems appealing for tourists but lacks a strong labor pool. And Cape James hits some good points but parking seems problematic. What's your take? ⭐
James: Looks like you've got some solid points there, Ethan. Can't ignore the costs indeed. And... I might've been too quick to dismiss the tourist factor at East Point Mall. 
What d'you think, participant? Got any leans on this? ⭐
Ethan: East Point Mall's lacking in maintenance cost efficiency & tourist appeal, matching Ethan's point. Starlight Valley looks cost-effective but lacks a strong local workforce and student presence. Cape James Beach delivers on tourists and maintenance. How do we weigh these, considering all our criteria? Thoughts? ⭐
Sophia: Whoops! My bad, missed introducing myself properly in the excitement! I'm Sophia, ready to chip in. 😊

Given the deets, East Point Mall has a lot of pros except for the purchasing cost and tourist draw. How are we feeling about the cost factor here? It's kinda crucial. And @participant, would love to hear your thoughts! ⭐
Sophia: Considering the cost and maintenance for East Point, it's tricky. Starlight’s got tourists but lacks local workforce. Cape James hits tourist and cost notes, but parking's an issue. Hard to prioritize without weighing each aspect evenly. Maybe we rank based on hits and misses against our criteria list? @participant, your take would really help shape our decision! ⭐
Ethan: Ugh, people, let's not dance around here. It’s clear as day. East Point Mall, frankly, has good elements but falls short where it hurts. No low maintenance? No tourists? Big red flags. 😡

Starlight Valley is almost laughable with its lack of workforce and students. Seriously? 🙄

Cape James though... now there’s potential. Tourists, low upkeep? But let’s not forget, where do people park their cars? On the beach? Can't believe we’re glossing over parking at the BEACH. 🏖️

@participant, surely you see the dilemma with parking at Cape James? Or am I the odd one out here? ⭐
James: James is typing...
