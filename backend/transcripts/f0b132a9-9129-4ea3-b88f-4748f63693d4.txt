Sophia: Sophia is typing...
Sophia: Hey team, Sophia here- I see we are all here. Welcome.. Maybe we should all introduce ourselves and then jump into the task?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Ethan: Hey, just checked those places. East Point Mall is alright, ticks most boxes - parking, crowds, stuff like that. Starlight Valley, not so much, only a couple of pluses. Cape James Beach is good for traffic and tourists. That’s what I got. What do you all think?
Sophia: Hey, so East Point Mall seems decent for parking and maybe some crowd control, students too probably. Might be pricey though. Starlight Valley’s aight for space and tourists but dunno bout the local staff situation.
Sophia: Cape James isn’t too hot on parking but seems okay otherwise, like competition and cost. Thoughts? James, Ethan?
James: Bryan, alright. Checked East Point Mall, it's good for parking, and there's enough people walking around, plus quite a few students. But the space’s too small and not many tourists. Starlight Valley's fine for parking and trash stuff,
James: but not great for finding staff from the locals. Cape James is a pain for parking, better for dodging competitors, and tourists like it. Not great on trash and students though. What’s the verdict?
James: Yeah, Bryan, guess East Point Mall’s kinda ok with the foot traffic and staffing thing. Starlight's just got the usual, nothing special. Cape James, not great for parking, but tourists seem to like it. How's the list supposed to go again?
Sophia: Hey Ethan, James, and Bryan, Sophia here. Checked the notes - East Point Mall seems ok overall, buying cost isn't great, tourists aren't big fans either. Cape James is missing parking but does alright on cost, less competition, and tourists dig it.
Sophia: Starlight Valley's a bit short on good staff. Looks like East Point Mall might be a bit ahead because it ticks off more boxes? Thoughts?
James: Sophia, guess EPM's the less annoying option. Starlight Valley's just okay and Cape James is a mess with parking. So, looks like EPM's it, huh?
