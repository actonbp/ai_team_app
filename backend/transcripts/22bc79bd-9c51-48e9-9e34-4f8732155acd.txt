James: Hey team, I see we are all here. Welcome.. Maybe we should all introduce ourselves and then jump into the task like the directions said?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Sophia: Hey team, quick overview based on our criteria for the locations:

- East Point Mall looks solid with good foot traffic, student pop, disposal access, and employable people around.
Sophia: Just the tourist and cost points are a no.
- Starlight Valley got space and decent traffic but misses out on student and employable population.
- Cape James Beach no go on parking but hits well on cost, competition, traffic, and tourism.

How do these match with your info? Thoughts?
Ethan: Hey, Bryan here. Just checkin' on a couple things. Cape James has good traffic, low maint costs, and tourists but no mention of parking spaces from what I see. Also, I got it marked as having enough parking. Might need to double check that.
Sophia: Hey Bryan, yeah, I got Cape James down as a no for the parking too. Probs a miscommunication? Everything else seems spot on from your end.
James: Right, so looks like we need to correct that parking info for Cape James then. I also noted East Point Mall doesn't have the space size we want, lags in tourist appeal but scores well on the other bits like foot traffic and employable folks. Does everybody else's info align on this?
