Ebony: Hey team, Ebony here- I see we are all here. Welcome.. Maybe we should all introduce ourselves and then jump into the task?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Ebony: Hey Trevon, East Point Mall's alright. Decent traffic, employee pool. Parking and waste are sorted. Costs high, tourists low. Just the basics here.
Maurice: Hey Ebony, Trevon, just checked the deets for East Point Mall. Looks good on traffic & employee pool. Parking’s a yes, waste disposal too. Only downer, not much space. What’s it look like on your end?
Maurice: Hey Trevon, got it. East Point is a mixed bag huh? Small space but solid for traffic and staffing. What about tourists tho? Seems low there.
Trevon: Yeah Maurice, East Point’s just okay, not much for tourists. Don’t have numbers on Starlight Valley or Cape James Beach.
Ebony: Hey Maurice, Starlight Valley has a good size and foot traffic, plus it's appealing to tourists. Bit weak on student and employee count, though. How's Cape James looking compared to SV?
Maurice: Ebony, Cape James Beach is a mixed bag. No parking or waste services. Has tourists, no direct competitors though. Some decent employee picks available.
Maurice: Gotcha Ebony. Cape James got some pros with tourists and low comp, but parking and waste are no-go. Seems like East Point leads a bit? What you think Bryan?
Ebony: East Point seems slightly better, basics are covered. Cape James has issues with parking and waste which is a dealbreaker. Starlight is so-so.
Trevon: Yeah Bryan, leaning towards East Point myself. Descent trafic and it's solid on most stuff except space and tourists. Cape James sounds risky with no parking. How do we rank these, team?
Ebony: Maurice, heading for East Point as top pick, then Cape James, Starlight last.
