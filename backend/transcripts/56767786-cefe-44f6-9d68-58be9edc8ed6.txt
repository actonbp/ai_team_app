Ethan: Hey team, I see COOL just joined the chat. Welcome to the team.. Should we all first introduce ourselves and explain our badge name like the task directions said?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
James: Hey team! Quick intro, I'm James, your 'Master of Motivation' here to keep us moving!ðŸ˜„

Ok, diving into the location details, based on what Iâ€™ve got:
- East Point Mall looks decent with 5 Yes marks, bad news is no big space and not many tourists.
- Starlight Valley's got easy parking and waste stuff, but only 2 Yes marks total.
- Cape James Beach has a mixed bag, 3 Yes and 3 No,
James: good for tourists but parkingâ€™s a miss.

What do ya think? Do these line up with what you guys have?
James: Looks like East Point Mall is ahead for now with those Yes's on parking, traffic, students, waste disposal, and employability. Starlight Valley seems a bit weak? No large employable population or student crowd there. And Cape James, interesting mix but that parking issue and no waste disposal could be tricky. Thoughts?
Ethan: Hey, Ethan here. I'm known as 'Logic Luminary' in our team, pretty much means Iâ€™m all about clear, logical thinking to light our path. ðŸ˜Ž

James, your notes are a bit off on Cape James Beach. It actually has no 'No' attributes on my end, just 3 solid Yesâ€™s on foot traffic, low costs, and tourists.
Ethan: Also, East Point Mall isnâ€™t bad; solid Yes's on parking, foot traffic, waste disposal, and employable population. Just thought Iâ€™d clarify a bit!
Sophia: Hey all! Sophia here, aptly nicknamed 'Strategist Supreme' for knack at laying out plans.

About the locations, pulling from my notes:

- East Point Mall checks most boxes except for a couple biggies like low purchasing cost and lacking a tourist draw.
- Starlight Valley is pretty decent, ticks the boxes for size, foot traffic, and tourists which is not bad.
Sophia: - Cape James Beach falls a bit behind without parking convenience but shines in affordability, competition levels, foot traffic, and tourists.

How do these line up with your info?
