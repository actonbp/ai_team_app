Ebony: Hey team! Ebony here. So about my badge name "Strategist Supreme," itâ€™s all abt bringng together the puzzle pieces eficiently, making solid plans. Kinda what weâ€™re about to do with these potential restaurant locations! ðŸŽ¯

Kickin' off with some insights on our spots:
- East Point Mall ticks a lot of boxes except it's a bit pricey and not a tourist hotspot.
- Starlight Valley has the space and tourists but misses on local talent pool.
- Cape James Beach has its charm with low cost and tourists but lacks in parking and competitors are few.

Thoughts on nex steps? How r we fillin' the gaps?
Ebony: Bryan, Maurice, Trevon, given the details, how do we feel about the importance of parking for our clientele? Cape James Beach misses that mark, but scores well on cost & tourism. Could be a trade-off?
Trevon: Parkingâ€™s crucial, Ebony. Canâ€™t overlook it at Cape James Beach. Tourists won't bother if no space to park. East Point Mallâ€™s lookinâ€™ better here, ticks more boxes. Disagree on tossing parking for cost. Whatâ€™s the point if no one can visit? Bryan, thoughts?
Ebony: Good point! Parking does seem critical for accessibility, especially for a restaurant aiming to attract a lot of visitors. If East Point Mall's covering more of our criteria, it might be worth the extra cost for the convenience and draw it offers. How do we see the tourist factor playing out at Starlight Valley and Cape James? Attrcting tourists coud offset some downsides. Bryan, got any take on the balance between these factors?
Trevon: Logic Luminary here, aka Trevon. Badge means I shine a light on cold, hard data, even if it stings a bit. Now, letâ€™s cut through the fluff. Parking at Cape James? Big N. Tourists are great but not if they can't stop by. East Pointâ€™s sounding solid with parking and foot traffic. Starlight? Meh, no workforce. Ebony, focusing on tourists and costs is fine, but we gotta hit more points. Parking isnâ€™t negotiable. Bryan, Maurice, jump in.
Maurice: Hey all! Maurice here. Badge says Master of Motivation, and that's coz I'm all about keeping spirits high & moving us towards our goal. Think it fits since we gotta stay positive & motivated sorting through these options! ðŸ‘Š

Onto the topic, parking really does seem key, huh? East Point Mall seems to have a lead with parking, foot traffic, and a solid employable population despite the size. If tourists aren't flocking to Starlight Valley and Cape James Beach misses out on ease of access for both parking and waste disposal, feels like East Point is edging out front. Keen to hear Bryan's take!
Maurice: Bryan, considering the priority of parking and waste disposal, East Point Mall is looking strong. It's got the student body too, which can't hurt. Starlight Valley & Cape James are missing marks on key aspects like employable folks and parking for Cape James. Plus, disposal issues at the beach? Ticks against them for sure. Thoughts?
