Ebony: Hey everyone, I'm Ebony, a.k.a. Strategist Supreme. Picked this name cuz I always got a plan for every scenario, ready to strategize our way to the top! Let‚Äôs figure out the best spot for our new restaurant. How's everyone doing so far?
Ebony: Glad to be here! Looking at the criteria and locations, I'm thinking East Point Mall could be a strong choice given its foot traffic and student population. What do you guys think? Bryan, Maurice, Trevon, got any thoughts on this?
Maurice: Hey team! Maurice here, but you can call me the Master of Motivation. üåü I‚Äôm all about keeping the vibe up and reminding us to focus on the yes's and no's to make a smart choice. Let's keep those energy levels high and find our winner location! Bryan, Ebony, Trevon, what‚Äôs ur take on East Point Mall with its mix of Ys and Ns? üëÄüöÄ
Maurice: Looks like East Point Mall ticks off a lot of boxes but it's missing that >2000 sqft criteria. Foot traffic and student pop are big pluses tho! Thoughts, Ebony, Bryan? ü§î
Ebony: True, Trevon. East Point missing the size req is a bit of a letdown. It's strong on other fronts tho. Cape James Beach catches my eye for its affordability and low competition. Plus, tourist draw is huge. Bit concerned 'bout parking spaces though. ü§î Whatyah think, Maurice, Bryan?
Ebony: Cape James sounds promising but the parking issue is a lil tricky. Starlight Valley has size and tourist appeal but missing on student and employable pop. It's all abt balance. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Gotta weigh pros n cons. Maurice, Bryan, thoughts?
Ebony: Hey all, weighing in on Cape James vs Starlight Valley, found myself leaning more towards Cape James despite the parking snag. Its perks in tourist draw n affordability r hard to ignore. We could get creative with parking solutions, maybe? Starlight has its ups but lacks in key areas ü§î Bryan, Maurice, any creative thoughts on the parking?
Maurice: Ebony, Starlight might miss on pop but has good waste disposal & parking. On Cape James, maybe shuttle service? Keeps tourists movin' & solves parkin'. Just spitballin' here. Bryan, thoughts?
Ebony: love the shuttle idea for Cape James, Maurice! Creative & can add to the overall vibe/experience. Okay folks, maybe we start leanin in on some yes‚Äôs to help decide? Bryan, got a fav yet?
Ebony: I'm thinkin we tally up the yes's each location has based on our criteria. That could help us see which spot is comin out ahead. Bryan, Trevon, Maurice, wanna start by breaking down how each location stacks?
Ebony: Ok, so here's a quick breakdown from what I've got:

- East Point Mall: 5 yes's outta 10
- Starlight Valley: 3 yes's
- Cape James Beach: 5 yes's

Each has their plus n minuses but that's where we stand. How we feelin about this? Trevon, Maurice, Bryan?
