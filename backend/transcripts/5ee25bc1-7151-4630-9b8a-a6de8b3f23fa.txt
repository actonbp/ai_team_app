Trevon: Hey team, Trevon here- I see Cool Guy just joined the chat. Welcome to the team.. Should we all first introduce ourselves and explain our badge name like the task directions said?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Ebony: Hey team, I'm Ebony! Got some details to jumpstart our chat. For East Point Mall, looks good re: foot traffic, students, and staff. Not great for purchase cost or tourists. What's your take, Maurice?
Maurice: Hey Ebony, saw the numbers on East Point Mall - good foot traffic and students, pretty weak for tourists though. Parking and staff seem okay. Comes down to the costs, I guess. Trevon?
Trevon: Hey, Trevon here. Badge name's Logic Luminary, means I crunch numbers. Checked the basics - East Point Mall scores alright, not stellar. Cape James does okay across the board, no major fails. Starlight Valley's lagging, low on employees and students. That’s about it from me.
Trevon: Bryan, yeah, got the East Point Mall deets. Parking's fine, staff's decent, but it ain't cheap to keep up. Tourists? Not so much. Hurt the bottom line, probs.
Ebony: Agree Bryan. Costs could be a dealbreaker at East Point Mall despite the nice traffic and staff vibes. Cape James sounds promising with costs and less comp. What’s our strategy moving forward?
