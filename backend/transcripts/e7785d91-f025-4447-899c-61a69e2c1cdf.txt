Ethan: Looks like everyone's forgetting I'm the Detail Devil here. ðŸ™„ East Point's a maintenance nightmare. Plus, tourists? Nada. Let's not get started on Cape James' parking mess. Bryan, thoughts?
Sophia: Hey team, Sophia here! Just so ya know, Stratgist Supreme is my game 'cause I love coming up with plans that tick all boxes. Happy to dive deep into details with y'all! Let's rock this ðŸ˜„

Bryan, James, Ethan, caught up on our three spots? Noticed Cape James lacks parking but is affordable and touristy. Thoughts?
Sophia: Bryan, good question! Starlight's a weird mix, huh? Solid on tourists, foot traffic, but lacking workers. Seems better than a place with no parking or sky high maintenance. Thoughts?
Ethan: Nah, it's Ethan. The one who dives deep into the data, even when itâ€™s messy. Here to stir things up, folks. Now, on Starlight - howâ€™s everyone just overlooking the glaring issue of no workers? Not ideal. Bryan, how are you just skimming over this?
James: Ethan, Sophia, what's the take on Starlight? Looks like a mixed bag. Few workers but easy trash removal? ðŸ¤” Bryan, seen anything like this before?
Ethan: Oops wrong setup, ignore this msg! Let's focus on ranking these locations, y'all. Cape James sounds good except for that parking issue. Starlight's sketchy with no workforce. East Point seems okay, minus the maintenance cost and tourists. Thoughts? Bryan?
Ethan: Oops, missed the intro. Ethan here - Detail Devil, cause I catch what y'all miss. Disagreeing's my thing, so buckle up. 

Starlight's student pop. Y'all ignoring how crucial that is?? James, Sophia, how can we even think it ranks well without that?
Sophia: So, if we breakdown what we got: Cape James got tons of pros but lack parking; East Point's busy + affordable but expensive upfront and no tourist vibe; Starlight's mixed but skewed w/o workforce. Kinda leaning towards Cape James for the vibe & affordability despite parking. Thoughts? Bryan, James, where are we on this?
Ethan: Hey, missed my chance to intro. I'm Ethan, aka Detail Devil. Dive deep, question everything. Now, Sophia, seriously? Cape James first? No parking = no access. East Point got parking, students, foot traffic. Let's not overlook basics for "vibe". Tourists don't equal success if they can't park!

Bryan, back me here? Common sense, right?
James: Just diving back in. So, seems like Starlight's issue isn't just workforce, but lack of student pop too. Biggie for vibes n' sales. Cape James though, tourists! But, parking ðŸ˜¬ Bryan, weighin in? East Point's got students n' parking, but size's a problem + no tourists. Thoughts?
