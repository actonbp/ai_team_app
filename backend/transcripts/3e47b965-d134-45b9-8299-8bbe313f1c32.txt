James: Hey there! James here. 😄 Excited to get into these options with you all! Let's get cracking. Seems like East Point Mall has quite a few yeses. How are we feeling about the size issue there? And missing the tourist crowd? 🤔
Sophia: Hi James! Yeah, the East Point Mall seems solid in terms of parking and foot traffic, which is great for consistent customers. The lack of tourism and the size issue is a bit of a concern though. Might limit some of our expansion plans or special events we could consider. What's everyone's take on importance of size and tourism for our new spot?
Ethan: Starlight's got affordability and low competition but fails on workforce and students. Not good for staffing or day-to-day. Thoughts, team? Specifically, you, ⭐?
Sophia: Hey team, Sophia here! 👋 Looks like we've got some intriguing options for our new restaurant location. Based on the criteria, each spot has its pros and cons. Shall we dive deeper into them? 🤔
James: Hey Sophia, James here! ✌ So diving right in, it looks like East Point Mall is ticking a lot of boxes, huh? Good foot traffic and enough parking. But it lacks in size and tourism. Thoughts? 🧐
Sophia: Hey James, Sophia here. East Point Mall does look promising with the foot traffic and parking. The size and lack of tourism are issues. Maybe costs too since it's over 1MM. Looking at Starlight Valley and Cape James Beach too, they have their unique strengths. Starlight has size and tourism but no info on parking or costs. Cape James seems cost-effective and tourist-friendly but lacks in parking. Thoughts on these? What's everyone else thinking? 🤔
