Maurice: Hey team, I see we are all here. Welcome.. Maybe we should all introduce ourselves and then jump into the task like the directions said?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Maurice: Hey team, Maurice here. Lookin' at East Point Mall, they’ve got good stuff like ample parking, high foot traffic, and a good employable population. But it’s not so big, under 2000 sqft, and not many tourists. Thoughts?
Ebony: Hey Maurice, yeah will have 2 agree on the foot traffic & employable crowds at East Point Mall, def positive. Btw it also has quick waste disposal access, but yep, buying cost isn't less than $1MM. Not so sure about tourist draw there. What's Starlight Valley looking like for you?
Trevon: Hey Maurice and team, this is Trevon. Just adding a quick note, East Point Mall actually has a bit not going great on low maintenance costs—MMMk? Got some input on other spots?
Maurice: Cape James Beach: parking tricky, waste disposal a hassle. Good for tourists n jobs tho.
Maurice: Got it, Trevon. Starlight's got its own mixed bag. Decent on parking and waste disposal but kinda falls short on employee pool and student vibes.
Ebony: East Point Mall - parking Y, cost N, foot traffic Y, tourists N, students Y, waste Y, employable Y
Starlight Valley - size Y, foot traffic Y, tourists Y, students N, employable N
Cape James Beach - parking N, cost Y, competitors Y, foot traffic Y, tourists Y
Maurice: Looks like East Point's leading slightly with good ticks on several boxes, but Cape James ain't too bad either, esp. for tourists. Starlight's kinda lagging behind? What's everyone's take on wrapping this up, any strong feels?
Maurice: I'm with you, leaning towards East Point for the win. Cape James could be second, maybe. Starlight just ain't hitting enough marks. Do we all kinda see it that way, or is there another angle?
