James: Hey team, James here! 👋 Just looked over our locations. How do we feel about East Point Mall's lack of space but good foot traffic & student pop?
Ethan: East Point Mall seems cramped and costly. Not ideal. 
Starlight Valley looks cheap but lacks manpower and students. Thoughts on Cape James Beach? Looks solid minus waste issue.
Sophia: Hi James! 👋 Sophia here. Considering the criteria, East Point Mall's good foot traffic and student population are big pluses, but the high purchasing cost could be a drawback. What's everyone else's take on this? 😊

James: Sounds like we're leaning towards Cape James Beach minus the waste and parking issues. Starlight Valley seems too quiet on the people front. East Point has its benefits but might be too snug? 😬 Thoughts?
