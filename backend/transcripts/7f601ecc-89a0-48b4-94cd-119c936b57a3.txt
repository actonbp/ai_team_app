Ethan: Hey everyone, Ethan here. Did we miss making note of some criteria for Starlight Valley and Cape James Beach, or are we simply ignoring important facts? Seems like we're barely scratching the surface. ‚≠ê, have you got any input on this?
Ethan: Doesn't look like we're considering the full picture for Starlight Valley and Cape James Beach. Cape James has the tourist draw, but what about parking and size? Sounds ideal but missing details. ‚≠ê, thoughts?
Sophia: Hi Ethan, Sophia here! Good point! Let's dive deeper into the criteria for Starlight Valley and Cape James Beach. What are your thoughts, Ethan? And also, what about you, James? Have you noticed anything we're missing or should prioritize for these spots? ‚≠ê, we'd love to hear your input as well!
James: Hey team, James here! üëã Quick thought - Cape James lacks parking and waste disposal but wins on tourists and low competition. Seems like a mixed bag. Thoughts, ‚≠ê?
