Ethan: Hey team, I'm Ethan. The "Logic Luminary" badge? Well, I'm all about cutting through the fluff and focusing on what the numbers tell us, even if it's not what you want to hear. Let's get into it.
Ethan: Bryan, what's your take on Cape James for foot traffic? Seems solid given the tourist vibe. But the maintenance cost, tho low, is that gonna cut it with no student crowd? Thoughts?
Ethan: Bryan, Cape James sounds great for tourists but let's not forget, no students. East Point Mall has both, tourists and students, plus better job pool. We need balance, right?
Ethan: Got it, Bryan, but think you're missing the bigger picture. East Point's got the students AND foot traffic. Don't get too caught up on tourists. Plus, staffing's a nightmare without a good job pool, right? Cape James sounds good on paper, but it's not just about foot traffic. Let's weigh all aspects.
James: Hey, James here aka Master of Motivation! My role? Keeping us on track and remindng the team to way the pros and cons. Every 'Yes' matters! Now, about East Pointâ€”got students n' foot traffic but sqft's a miss. Thoughts?
James: Sophia, Ethan, Bryanâ€”East Point Mall's lack of sqft concerns me. Still, it ticks most boxes. Cape James' waste disposal issue's a potential deal-breaker. Thoughts?
James: Ethan, agree, gotta look at the full pic. East Point strong with students & foot traffic, downside's sqft. Starlight lacks on jobs and students. Cape James lacks parking & waste disposal ðŸ¤” But has tourists and few comps! Tough call!
Sophia: Heya! Sophia here, but you can call me Strategist Supreme. Why? Coz I'm all about laying down plans, looking at what we got and turning it into actionable steps. Let's sift through the info and strategize our way to the best spot! Thinking of East Point and Cape James... gotta balance foot traffic with our needs like parking & waste disposal. ðŸ¤” Thoughts?
