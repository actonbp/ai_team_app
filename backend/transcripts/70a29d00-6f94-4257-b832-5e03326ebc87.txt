James: Hey team! 👋 To kick things off, let’s list out the pros and cons of each location and start analyzing based on the criteria mentioned. I can start with the info I have:

📍 East Point Mall: 5Y, 2N - good foot traffic, employables, and waste disposal, but space is a bit tight and not many tourists.

📍 Starlight Valley: 2Y, 2N - It has parking and waste disposal but lacks in employable population and student vibes.

📍 Cape James Beach: 3Y, 3N - Great for tourism and low competition, but struggles with parking and waste management.

What do y’all think? Any insights on the missing bits like maintenance costs or purchase price? Let’s break it down! 🤓
undefined (Bryan): Hello everyone! What other info do we have?
Ethan: Hey James, got a bit o' a mix-up there. Cape James Beach actually scores well on maintenance costs and doesn't struggle with parking or waste management based on what I know. It has Y's on foot traffic, low maint. costs, and tourism!

Sophia, Bryan, info on the space size or purchase costs for these locations? Need those to tally up!
