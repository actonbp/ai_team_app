Ethan: Hey team, Ethan here. Heard East Point is a mixed bag. Seriously, a big NO for tourists? That's a missed goldmine. Bryan, thoughts? You digging any of these based on what we know?

Sophia: Just realized, Cape James seems like a strong contender if we focus on the tourist angle and low purchasing cost. Parking and waste disposal tough, but manageable? Thoughts? Especially Bryan, how you see it?
