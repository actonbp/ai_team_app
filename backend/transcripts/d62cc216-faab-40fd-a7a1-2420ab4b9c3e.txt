Ebony: Hey everyone! It's Ebony here. Just so y'all know, my badge name "Strategist Supreme" means I'm all about crafting the plan. Ready to dive into the details and map out our best moves. Let's get to ranking these spots! 

Looking at East Point Mall first, it checks a lot of our boxes like parking, foot traffic, student crowd, waste disposal, and employable folks. Though, not great on tourist attraction and it's over our budget. Thoughts?
Trevon: Hey, Trevon here. Just so u know, my badge "Logic Luminary" Is a joke cause I'm the one who usually flips the script. Always got a diff angle, ya know?

Ebony, gotta disagree straight up. East Point Mall's maintenance cost is a big NO. Can't ignore that. Also, missing out on tourists? That's $$$ walking away. Got better options. Let's not settle yet.
Ebony: I hear ya, Trevon. Definitely, maintenance is a key factor. What about Starlight Valley then? It's got space, tourists, and foot traffic but might be lacking in terms of the student crowd and employability. How do we feel this weighs against the cons of East Point?
Maurice: Hey team! Maurice here, aka Master of Motivation 😎 I'm all about keeping the vibes positive and pushing us toward success! Let's crush this!

For Starlight Valley, lackin' on student crowd & employablity, right? Still got good disposal access + parking. How's that stack up for us compared to East Point? Ebony, thoughts?
Trevon: Maurice, Starlight Valley lacking big time on workers & students. Doesn't look great, eh? Let's not gloss over those. Huge for business. Ebony, really, East Point ain't perfect but at least got workforce and students. Starlight? Meh. What about Cape James Beach? Seems that's got the vibes.
Maurice: Cape James is mixed. 💥 Pops with tourists, low comp., & got the workers. But no parking & trash trouble. Plus, students not really there. Ebony, parking's a headache, huh? Could be a dealbreaker. 🚗🚫
Ebony: Yeah, parking at Cape James sounds tricky... 🤔 But, considering our criteria, it's interesting to note that despite the parking and waste disposal issues, Cape James Beach has a good mix of positives too, especially with tourists and fewer competitors, which could drive higher traffic. How do we weigh these against the cons, team?
Maurice: Ebony, weighin it all up, we can't ignore Cape James' strong tourist draw and low comp. Space battles aside, it's got charm. East Point's got more checks but can't discount the tourist $$$ at Cape James. Starlight's prob last for me, lackin more on our list. 🏖️💡 Thoughts?
Maurice: Agreed, Starlight's a pass for me too. Let's line 'em up based on what we got. I'm thinkin:

1. East Point Mall - lotsa yes's despite some no's.
2. Cape James Beach - Tourist gold, but parking & waste are issues.
3. Starlight Valley - Missin' too much for a win.

Bryan, Ebony, y'all on board with this rankin? 🚀
Trevon: Bryan, Maurice, I gotta push back. Overlooking East Point's maintenance costs & tourist gap is a miss. Starlight and Cape James have their perks but we're missing the full pic. 

1. East Point's got volume but costs.
2. Cape James hits tourist but misses basics.
3. Starlight's last but not far behind.

Reconsider?
undefined (Bryan): Yes, I am on board with that ranking
