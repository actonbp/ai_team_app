James: Hey team, James here! I see Cool Guy just joined the chat. Welcome to the team! I'll start us off since I've been here the longest.... Hey y'all! It's James here, the Master of Motivation! Think of me as your personal hype man. Ready to dive in and make this project shine.
Ethan: Sophia, cost is a big deal, but not everything. East Point has traffic and students. Big pluses! Cape James seems better tho, thoughts? Bryan, what's your take?
Sophia: Hey everyone! I'm Sophia, ready to dive into this. Based on what we've got, how're we feeling about East Point Mall's higher cost? Seems like it checks most boxes except for cost and tourism.
