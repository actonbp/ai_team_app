About East Point Mall that Ebony mentioned, it sounds pretty solid with parking, foot traffic,
Trevon: and a good workforce. Lack of tourist appeal could be a minor issue though. Thoughts?...
Maurice: Heya! I'm Maurice, aka "Master of Motivation" because I'm all about keeping the energy up and the team moving forward! ðŸš€

About East Point Mall, agreeing with Ebony and Trevon here,
Maurice: the spot has its perks like foot traffic and a ready workforce. The lack of big tourist crowd is a bit of a letdown though. What are your thoughts, Bryan?
Ebony: Good points on East Point Mall, guys. Let's also look at Starlight Valley. It ticks the boxes for size, foot traffic, and tourists. But seems a bit weak on workforce and student population. What do you all think about balancing these factors?
Trevon: Starlight Valleyâ€™s not bad, but lacking on the student and workforce front makes it kinda sketch for long-term. Not much help if there's nobody to work or eat there, right? What you guys think?
Ebony: Starlight Valley missing workforce & students. Cape James Beach probs with parking but better cost, competitors, foot traffic, tourists. Prefer Cape over Starlight. Thoughts?
Trevon: Ebony, Cape James lookin good â€“ low upkeep + high tourist traffic, got my vote over Starlight.
Trevon: Maurice, going w Cape - good on tourists + low upkeep. East Point's mixed, Starlight's weak on workforce. Ranking: Cape, East Point, Starlight.
Trevon: No big cons at Cape, looks balanced.
