Ethan: Hey team, Ethan here. Let's not get sidetracked focusing on one location. Key is tallying YES's and NO's for each spot on all attributes. Share your unique info, let's get contrasting views out there. Starlight Valley's missing key elements like employable people and student vibe. Thoughts, fdhdh, James, Sophia?
Ethan: Definitely think East Point Mall is looking weak on the maintenace and tourist fronts. Might be a deal breaker. Also, Starlight's lack of students and employable folks? Not ideal. Cape James tho, ticks a lot of boxes with foot traffic, low costs, and tourists. Seems solid. James, Sophia got, any thoughts? Or disagree?
Ethan: Gotta say, fdhdh, missing the mark a bit. Maintenance and tourists arenâ€™t everything. East Point Mall has solid points - like the parking, student vibe, and employable folks. And, don't forget the waste disposal perk. Not overlooking Cape James, but let's not put all eggs in one basket. What about the space size and purchase cost? James, Sophia, any input on those?
