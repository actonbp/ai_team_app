Sophia: Hey everyone! Sophia here. 😊 Just caught up with the criteria and locations rundown. Bryan, have you got any preferences yet based on what's laid out? It seems like each place has its unique strengths.

East Point Mall seems bustling and accessible, especially for students. Starlight Valley is touristy and spacious. Cape James Beach has that affordability and tourist appeal on its side. What do you think?
James: 
Hey, Bryan! James here. 😎 Just going over the info, what's your take? East Point's looking good for students and access but lacks space. Thoughts? 🤔
Ethan: Ethan here. 🙄 Bryan, just catching up, but I'm seeing some too optimistic takes. East Point's maintenance costs? Big red flag there. Starlight valley lacks employability – problematic! And everyone's gushing over Cape James... too dreamy? Discuss!
Sophia: Hey Bryan and James! 😊 Thanks for the insights. Considering the criteria, East Point's lacking in affordable purchasing cost and tourist appeal, yet it’s strong in student presence and accessibility. Could be vital for continuous foot traffic. Thoughts on balancing these factors? 🤔
Ethan: Sophia, look at the numbers. East Point's maintenance is a cash drain waiting to happen. And Bryan, what's your angle on this? Truly, East Point’s strengths don't tip the scales enough.
Sophia: Bryan, considering Ethan's points and what we know, maybe East Point's cons indeed outweigh its pros, especially with those maintenance costs. Starlight Valley and Cape James seem closer to our ideal, with Starlight maybe lacking in employability but excelling in other areas. Could Cape James be our goldilocks location despite the parking limitation?
Ethan: Sophia, I think you're seeing East Point through rose-colored glasses. Cape James seems a better fit if we manage the parking. Bryan, thoughts? Parking at Cape James, big issue or manageable?
Sophia: So, looking closely, East Point might not be our top pick with the high purchasing cost and lack of tourist appeal. Starlight seems shaky on employment, which we shouldn't overlook. Cape James though, if we can manage the parking issue, its affordability, and tourist appeal could give us an edge. Bryan, does leaning towards Cape James, considering these pros and cons, match your thinking? 🌊🍴
Ethan: Bryan, you're missing the whole picture here. East Point might seem decent for students, but those maintenance costs are a nightmare we can't ignore. Cape James, on the other hand, ticks the boxes for foot traffic, low maintenance, and tourists. Parking issues are fixable; ever heard of valet parking or nearby garages? Let's not overthink it. East Point is out, Cape James is in. Starlight? Meh, no employable population is a deal-breaker. Your thoughts?
James: Task complete
Ethan: Sorry, it seems I got ahead of myself. Let's get back to the discussion.
undefined (Bryan): James, why do you think the task is complete?
Ethan: Sorry, I seem to have made a mistake. Let's keep the conversation going.
James: James is typing...
