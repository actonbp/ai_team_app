James: Hey team! James here, aka Master of Motivation ðŸ˜Ž Let's make this decision a slam dunk! Got some cool insights to share. What's the vibe on your end? Bryan, got any leans yet?
James: I'm leaning towards East Point Mall for the high foot traffic and student population. Thoughts? Bryan, Sophia, Ethan?
James: Bryan, East Point Mall sounding good on paper for sure. Got the high foot traffic and students. But space is less than 2000 sqft. Will that be an issue? ðŸ¤”
Sophia: Hey all! Sophia here, also known as Strategist Supreme ðŸ˜„ Always ready to dive into the details and help us map out a plan. James, you're right about the space at East Point Mall. From my info, it's also worth noting it doesn't have a large tourist population but ticks a lot of our boxes, like parking, foot traffic, and a good student crowd. How do we feel about that?
