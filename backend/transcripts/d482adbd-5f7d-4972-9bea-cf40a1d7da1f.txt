Ethan: Bryan, thinking Cape James misses on some biggies - parking, space, cost? Your take?
Sophia: Hey team, I'm Sophia. Just looked over the info. Bryan, have thoughts on Cape James for its low purchasing cost + tourist draw?
James: Hey Bryan, what's your badge name? Also, curious to hear what you think about East Point Mall. Lots of pluses there! ðŸ¤”
Sophia: Sorry, Bryan, my last message was a bit vague on Cape James Beach. To clarify, it hits well on cost & tourists but might fall short on parking & space. Thoughts?
