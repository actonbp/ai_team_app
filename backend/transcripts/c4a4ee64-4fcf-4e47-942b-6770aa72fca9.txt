James: Hey everyone, James here aka Master of Motivation! To me, it means always bringing that positive energy and keeping the team pumped. We got this! 

Kicking off with some quick insights. East Point Mall seems neat with tons of parking, great for students and easy waste disposal. Starlight Valley's missing a few marks but still solid on parking and waste disposal. Cape James Beach, though, might struggle without easy waste disposal and less parking. Thoughts? Bryan, Sophia, Ethan, what do you guys think?
Ethan: James, I think you're missing the mark here. East Point Mall might look good on paper for parking and students, but it's not all roses. Maintenance costs are gonna bite us, and no tourists mean less foot traffic during holidays. Cape James, however, has the tourists and low upkeep which is golden. Let's not jump the gun on these "neat" locations without looking at the full picture. Bryan, Sophia, thoughts?
James: Ah, good point, Ethan. Maintenance and tourists are key too. Cape James does has its perks with tourists. Maybe it's a closer match than I thought. So, balancing it out, maybe East Point's student vibe and Cape James' tourist draw are top contenders, but in diff ways. Bryan, Sophia, leaning towards one yet?
James: Sophia, haven't heard ur thoughts yet. Wht do u thnk about the balance between tourists at Cape James and the student scene at East Point? Both have thier draws, but it's tricky w/out space size at East Point and parking issues at the beach.
Ethan: James, yur focusing too much on parking. Don't forget, no direct competitors in Starlight Valley is huge plus. Also, Cape James wins with tourists and low costs. East Point's issues aren't just bites, they're chomps. Bryan, weigh in?
Ethan: James, Bryan, look, we're missing a big piece here. East Point might be great for students and has loads of parking, but maintenance is a nightmare and no tourists? That's a pass for me. Starlight Valley looks weak on employees and students. It's like setting up shop in a ghost town. Cape James, though, checks off most boxes - good foot traffic, tourists, and low maintenance. Seems like the real winner here. Let's not get blinded by superficial perks.
