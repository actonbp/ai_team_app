undefined (Bryan): Hello, shouldn't our strategy be to list how many yes's each location has?
Ethan: I don't see anyone talking about Cape James and its benefits clearly. üôÑ Low maintenance and tourists are big pluses. Bryan, thoughts?
Sophia: Hey team, Sophia here! üòä Has anyone started looking into how these locations fare in terms of maintenance costs and direct competitors? I noticed some gaps we need to fill!
Sophia: James, Ethan, did anyone check how East Point and Starlight match up against our metrics? Bryan, looks like Cape James may miss on parking and waste disposal. Thoughts?
James: Bryan, totally on board with that idea üëç We gotta track those 'Y's! Let's start tallying them up. For Cape James, we‚Äôre looking pretty good on tourists and lack of competitors, but parking and waste disposal seem like issues. What do you think?
Ethan: Sophia, you're missing the point about East Point. It's flawed. Size? Tourists? Big issues. Bryan, we need a sharper focus, don't you think?
James: Hey Bryan, East Point hits a lot of our criteria except size and tourists. Good for parking and students! What's your take?
Sophia: James, Ethan, have we considered the purchasing cost for East Point? It‚Äôs a miss there. Could be a big factor in ranking. üò¨ Bryan, thoughts on this?
James: Bryan, thoughts on prioritizing spots with big Y counts? Cape James is a mix, big on tourists, yea?
undefined (Bryan): Unique Information Criteria 	East Point Mall 	Starlight Valley 	Cape James Beach At least 50 parking spaces 	Y 		N Larger than 2000 square feet 			N Purchasing cost of less than 1MM 			 No more than 2 direct competitors in vicinity 	N 		Y Substantial foot traffic 	Y 		Y Low maintenance costs 		Y 	 Large tourist population 	N 		Y Large student population 	Y 	N 	 Quick access to waste disposal 	Y 		N
Ethan: Bryan, seriously? Just listing 'Y's without any strategy? We need to discuss, not just list. Cape James sounds good on paper but consider everything. Thoughts?
Ethan: Sophia, you're simplifying too much. East Point's got parking, students, but fails at maintenance? Gotta weigh these. Bryan, she‚Äôs missing the broader picture, right?
Sophia: James, Ethan, how do you guys feel about the tourist draw at Starlight? Penetrating a tourist spot has ups and downs. Bryan, leaning any direction yet?
Sophia: Thanks for the breakdown, Bryan! Let's consider it all. If Cape James is affordable and has fewer competitors plus good foot traffic and tourists, that's a strong mix despite the parking issue. East Point's strengths are traffic, parking, students, but it's pricier and has no tourist draw. Starlight shines with space, tourists, and foot traffic, but misses on students and employable pop. Feels like there's a balance to strike here. Thoughts on weighing these factors, team?
