Ethan: Hey team, Ethan here. I'm the numbers guy who doesn't beat around the bush, so let's dive right in.

East Point Mall seems solid on parking, foot traffic, student population, waste disposal, and employable folks. But, it falls short on maintenance costs and tourists. Maintenance costs are a big deal; we can't ignore that.

Starlight Valley scores on purchase cost and lack of competitors but misses out on student and employee pools. Kinda limiting, don't you think?

Cape James Beach nails foot traffic, low maintenance, and tourists. Sounds like a jackpot for attracting a broad audience.

What's everyone else's take? Let's not get tunnel vision on single factors.
Ethan: Bryan, gimme ur thoughts. Don't just nod along. Cape James sounds too good? What's missing?
Sophia: Ethan, totally hear ya on Cape James. From my info, it's got substantial foot traffic and a big tourist draw, which is great. The downside? Cape James is lagging in parking spaces. This could be a biggie considering customer convenience. Whatchya think?
Sophia: Interesting points, Ethan and Bryan. East Point Mall covers a lot of our bases - parking, foot traffic, and a good student pop. It's shy on tourists, though. Cape James is tempting with that tourist draw and low maintenance, but parking's a miss. Starlight? It's big and tourist-friendly but might struggle with staffing. Feels like all have their pros and cons. Thoughts on how we balance these?
undefined (Bryan): Hi Guys, remember, that no one attribute is more important than others for this task. So Maybe let's just tally how many yes's each location has and focus on that? Remember we have unique information
Ethan: Sophia, parking at Cape James is a real issue, agreed. But we're missing the elephant in the room – cost! Starlight Valley's under 1MM. We gotta consider budgets, folks. East Point? Solid but maintenance costs = a headache. Let's not just chase tourists and foot traffic. 

James, haven't heard much from ya. What's your take on the budget side?
James: Hey folks, James here. Quick dive on East Point Mall - hits the mark on parking, foot traffic, student body, waste disposal, and workforce. But, misses tourist attraction and size reqs.

Starlight’s mixed. Good on parking and waste but misses on student & employee pool.

Cape James? Ace on tourists and competitors but flunks on parking and waste management.

Ethan, Sophia, Bryan - Seems like a tough trade-off between locations. Where do y’all lean considering the balance we need?

James: Ethan, budget's tight, agree. Stressing on purchase cost and maintenance. East Point’s tricky with those upkeep expenses. Cape James, though, high on vibe, low on infrastructure. Starlight shines money-wise, but will lack of skilled staff be a budget pitfall later? Tossing it back to you and Bryan - how we weighing these costs long-term?
undefined (Bryan): I have east point mall, 5 yes's; starlight valley: one yes, cape james beach four yes's...you guys?
Ethan: James, your concern about Starlight lacking skilled staff hurting the budget later is spot on. But, we can't ignore that upfront cost savings. Plus, East Point's high maintenance could bleed us dry before we see profit. Bryan, thoughts? Seems like we're playing a balancing act between costs and benefits here.
undefined (Bryan): Do you guys want to start counting yes's?
