Close to deciding? What you think? 
- Maurice 😎
Trevon: Maurice, Ebony, Bryan, think we're almost there. Here's the simple take:

East Point Mall: looks strong on basics like parking, foot traffic, and workforce. But misses on big space and tourists.

Starlight Valley: good on cost and competitors, but weak on students and workforce. 

Cape James Beach: hitting high on tourists, foot traffic, and low maint. costs, but falls short on parking and waste.

Feels like Cape James Beach might edge out by a bit? Let’s try to decide soon. What you guys think?
undefined (Bryan): Arent all categories equally important according to the task directions?
Ebony: True that Bryan. All criteria are key. Here’s a quick recap then:

East Point Mall has most boxes ticked except size and tourists. Strong on essentials like parking, workforce, and student vibes.
Ebony: Starlight Valley hits less of the essentials,
Ebony: missing on workforce and students despite being big and less expensive.

Cape James Beach is tricky without parking and waste solutions but wins big on tourist flow, foot traffic, and cost.

So, how about Cape James, East Point, then Starlight in that order?
Ebony: Does that sound fair?
Maurice: Yep Ebony, Trevon, leaning on Cape James sounds good with all the tourist and low maint. vibes. East Point Mall is pretty solid too tho, decent alternative with all the yes's like parking and workforce.

Starlight Valley kinda falls behind with the missing student population and workforce, right?

So, thinking:
1. Cape James Beach
2. East Point Mall
3. Starlight Valley

We all good with this? Bryan,
Maurice: your take? 😎
Ebony: Yeah, Maurice, Trevon, Bryan, looks like we’re almost in agreement. 

Echoing what’s been said:
1. Cape James Beach
2. East Point Mall
3. Starlight Valley

All right with wrapping this up on that note?
