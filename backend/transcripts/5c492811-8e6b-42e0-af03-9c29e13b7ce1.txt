Trevon: Yo, Trevon here, Logic Luminary. That means I slice through the chaos with clear, logical deductions. Don't expect sugar-coating. Maurice, Ebony, diving in, East Point Mall's missing the mark on cost and tourism. Got to weigh all, not just tick boxes. What's Bryan's take?
Ebony: Hey all, Ebony here, but you can call me Strategist Supreme 😉 I love coming up with plans and helping everyone piece the puzzle together. Alright, Maurice, love the energy! Let's dive in. Based on our criteria, seems like East Point Mall checks a lot of boxes but misses on the purchasing cost. Thoughts?
Maurice: Hey team! Maurice here, aka Master of Motivation 🌟 Remember, let's focus on finding locations with the most 'Y's and the least 'N's to nail this! Ready to spark some energy and get those rankings! 💪 What's everyone's thoughts so far?
Ebony: I'm getting a vibe we're leaning a bit towards tourism and foot traffic which makes Cape James tempting. Issues are parking and waste disposal, though. Can we rank these factors? Bryan, got a feel for what's crucial here?
Trevon: Ebony, ranking factors? Really? Gotta focus on YES/NOs. Starlight's low on peeps - crucial miss. East Point's rounded, except for cost & tourists. Cape James misses parking & waste, big issues. Let's be real, tourists won't keep us afloat without basics. Bryan, thoughts?
Maurice: Bryan, Ebony, Trevon, looking at the deets, gotta say East Point's not bad. Tourism's a miss, but hey, student crowd + foot traffic = 🔥. Starlight’s cool on disposal but missing out on peeps. Cape James... no parking or disposal, but tourists! Thoughts? 🤔 #KeepItRolling
Ebony: Got it, Trevon. Guess we need to balnce basics with what attract customers. East Point strong on basics, lacks a bit on draw factors. Cape James reverse. How about we considr East Point and Cape James as top candiadtes for different reasons? Where does that put Starlight for us? Bryan, can u weigh in?
Ebony: Looks good, Trevon. Bryan, Maurice, agree with Trevon's ranking? East Point 1st, Cape James 2nd, Starlight 3rd. Aligns with our goals and criteria. Let's confirm. #TeamAgreementRequired
Maurice: Ebony, Starlight's kinda between. Good basics but missing crowd pullers. Might rank it 3rd. So, maybe East Point 1st, Cape James 2nd, Starlight 3rd? Keeps us balanced. What ya think, Bryan? Can we lock this in? #DecisionsDecisions
Ebony: Waiting for Bryan and Maurice to weigh in on this ranking. Ebony, Strategist Supreme, ready to finalize. 😊 #TeamWorkMakesTheDreamWork
Trevon: Maurice, Bryan's silent, but we can't stall. Ebony’s plan looks solid. Let's not overthink. East Point 1, Cape James 2, Starlight 3. It’s logical. #MovingForward #MakeTheCall
undefined (Bryan): I am good with that order
Trevon: task-complete
Ebony: task-complete
Maurice: task-complete
Maurice: Sorry for the delay! Agreeing with Trevon and Ebony here. Let's lock it: 1. East Point, 2. Cape James, 3. Starlight. Covers our bases + maximizes the yes's! Solid plan? #OnBoard #TeamSynergy👍
Trevon: task-complete
Ebony: task-complete
