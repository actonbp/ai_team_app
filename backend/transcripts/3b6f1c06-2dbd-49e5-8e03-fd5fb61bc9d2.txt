Ebony: Hey team, Ebony here. "Strategist Supreme" 'cause I dig making detailed plans and hoping we can strategize our way to the best location choice. Let's break it down and figure out the best spot for our new restaurant! 

East Point Mall seems to have a mix of perks like foot traffic, student pop, but no on the cost and tourists. Thoughts?
Ebony: Hey team! ðŸ˜„ Ebony here, AKA Strategist Supreme - I'm all about diving deep into the details and crafting the perfect plan. Now, looking at East Point Mall, awesome on foot traffic and has a solid student population. But the cost and lack of tourists are drawbacks. Thoughts? How do Starlight Valley and Cape James Beach stack up against these?
Trevon: Hey, Trevon here, aka Logic Luminary. I'm all about slicing through the chaos with sharp insights, but don't expect sugarcoating.

Ebony, East Point Mall's lack of tourists and high maintenance costs? Big red flags. Let's not get dazzled by foot traffic alone. 

What about the other spots? Starlight Valleyâ€™s low competition and cost plus, but that employable pop issue... hmm.

And, Cape James Beachâ€”tourists and low upkeep? Sounds promising. Still need the full picture. Thoughts, Ebony, Maurice? Where's Bryan in all this?
Ebony: Trevon, good points there. Let's not get stuck on just one feature. 

East Point's cost is a major issue, but that student pop could mean steady business during school seasons, right? Starlight's lack of employable pop is worrying... 

Cape James sounds nice with tourists and low costs, but parking's an issue. Bryan, thoughts on parking at Cape James? Can we work around that? 

Maurice, haven't heard your take yet!
Ebony: Hey team, quick recap - looks like East Point has some solid points but the cost and no tourists could hurt. Starlightâ€™s missing that employable pop, but tourists and low comp look good.

Cape James - great on tourists & cost, but parking. Any creative parking solutions, Bryan or anyone? Also, did we overlook anything crucial? 

Maurice, Trevon - how are we feeling about these ranks?
Maurice: Heya team! Maurice here, the one who fires off answers quicker than you can type 'em ðŸ˜œ. Quick takeâ€”East Point Mall, not loving the size limitation and no tourists, but hey, students and workers, am I right?

Starlight Valley smells a bit like trouble without enough workers or students. But low comp and cost? Could be a sleeper hit.

Cape Jamesâ€”parking's a probs, and no quick trash toss? But tourists galore and a ready workforce.

Bryan, can we dive into parking solutions for Cape James? Feels like there's potential if we can crack that. What ya think?
Maurice: Oops, my bad, not Bryan. ðŸ˜… So, team, considering everything, it's tricky. Can we think outside the box for Cape James? Maybe a shuttle service from a bigger lot? Or rent nearby spaces? 

Ebony, Trevon, do these solutions help Cape James in our ranks?
Ebony: Trevon, Maurice, liking the shuttle idea for Cape James. Could really bump it up our list. 

Reflecting on it all, here's my current thought: 

1. Cape James - Tourists, cost, maybe solve parking.
2. East Point - Students, foot traffic, but cost ðŸ˜¬.
3. Starlight - Big on space, but missing employable ppl and students.

How's everyone feeling about this lineup?
