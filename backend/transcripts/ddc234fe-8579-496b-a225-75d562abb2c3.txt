Ebony: Hey team, it's Ebony here. Just to kick things off with my badge name, "Strategist Supreme" - kinda see it as a nod to my knack for plotting out solid plans and diving deep into strategy. Letâ€™s get down to ranking these locations! 

Iâ€™m starting us off with East Point Mall: great foot traffic, student presence, accessible waste disposal, and a good pool of potential employees. However, it's over the budget with no large tourist population. Thoughts?
Ebony: Oops, sorry for the confusion about repeating the badge name explanation, won't happen again! Moving on, looking at Starlight Valley next, it's rlly appealing for the tourist crowd and has enough space. But, it's missing a strong student pop. and a local workforce. Any1 has thoughts on this trade-off?
Trevon: Hey, Trevon here. So, "Logic Luminary" cuz I cut thru nonsense with sharp logic. Now, onto biz. Ebony, Starlight Valley's tourist appeal's nice, but no student or workforce? Big problem. East Point sounds solid, except the no tourist and high costs. We're missing some crucial info on Cape James Beach, anyone got details? ðŸ¤¨
Maurice: Hey team, Maurice here, AKA Master of Motivation! I'm all about keeping spirits high and pushing us forward. Let's crush this task!

Cape James Beach tidbits: no on the parking, yes for minimal competitors & tourists, nope for students & waste disposal, but yep, we've got a solid workforce pool. Thoughts on balancing these trade-offs? Bryan, Ebony, Trevon, what are your vibes on it?
Trevon: Cape's lack of parking & student pop. is a minus. But tourists & low cost? Big plus. Still, no waste disposal is a dealbreaker. Maurice, didn't catch that optimistic spin on missing parking and students. Reality check, please. ðŸ™„ Bryan, Ebony, weigh in?
Maurice: Trevon, feel ya on the waste disposal at Cape James. It's tricky! But, looking big picture - East Point ticks most boxes despite space issue. Good foot traffic, students, & workforce. Plus, got parking & waste sorted. Sounding a bit more promising to y'all? Ebony, Bryan, thoughts?
Ebony: Good points all around! East Point Mall seems to strike a balance here. Its drawbacks, like cost, might be worth it for its benefits. Besides, cost is a one-time issue vs. ongoing benefits of traffic & workforce. How we feeling about starting to rank these yet? Bryan, got any insights?
Maurice: Ebony, leaning to rank East Point higher too. It's got more yeas than nays, esp for our essentials. How bout we tally up positives vs negatives for a clearer pic? Ebony, Trevon, Bryan, sound good? Let's not let one con outweight the pros!
undefined (Bryan): I have 5 yeses for EPM: parking, foot traffic, student pop, waste, and large pop of empoyable; one yes for SV: low main cost, ; and 5 yes's for CJB: no more than 2 compet, foot traffic, large tourist pop, large pop of employable
