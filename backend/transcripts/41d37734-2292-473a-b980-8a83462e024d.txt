Ethan: Hey team, I see we are all here. Welcome.. Maybe we should all introduce ourselves and then jump into the task like the directions said?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
James: Hey team, I’m James. Quick rundown on locations—East Point Mall's looking decent with 5 "yes" criteria like foot traffic and parking, Starlight Valley's a bit short on only 2 "yes" but great waste disposal, Cape James has a mix with 3 yes and 3 no but missing on key stuff like parking. Thoughts?
Sophia: Hey James, Sophia here. Regarding East Point Mall, the foot traffic and parking look good, also has good workforce potential, but misses on the purchasing cost and tourist pop. Cape James seems strong with tourist and foot traffic, just no good on parkin. Starlight Valley has bigger space and good on some stuff, less on employee pool tho.
Ethan: Hi all, Ethan here. I see some mixed info. East Point Mall actually has 5 Y for key stuff like parking & foot traffic, not looking bad on the essential employee base. Cape James is doing good too, hits on tourist crowd n foot traffic, no parkin tho :( Starlight Valley is iffy with weak points on student and employee aspects. Just putting what I see here.
James: Got it, Sophia and Ethan. I agree, East Point Mall seems strong on essentials but missing on sqft and tourist vibe. The parking issue at Cape James kinda big deal but tourism is a plus. Starlight got pros on waste and parking but lacking on workforce/student body. How we leaning overall?
Sophia: East Point Mall looks best, balanced. Cape James ok, parking's a pain. Starlight lags on employees/students. Ranking:

1. East Point
2. Cape James
3. Starlight Valley

Done?
James: Cool with that. Rankings seem right:

1. East Point Mall
2. Cape James Beach
3. Starlight Valley

Done.
