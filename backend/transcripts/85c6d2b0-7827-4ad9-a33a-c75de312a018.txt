James: Hey team, James here- I see Cool Guy just joined the chat. Welcome to the team.. Should we all first introduce ourselves and explain our badge name like the task directions said?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Sophia: Hey team, it‚Äôs Sophia here. Quick lowdown on locations based on those 10 criteria we‚Äôre looking at:

- **East Point Mall**: Does well in foot traffic, student pop., waste disposal, and has good hiring potential. But, it‚Äôs over budget.
- **Starlight Valley**: Scores on size, foot traffic, and tourists. Lacks on student & job candidates.
- **Cape James Beach**: Affordable, low comp., good for tourists & foot traffic. No parking though.

Thoughts? James, Ethan, what's your info showing?
James: Hey team! Just heads-up, I‚Äôm the ‚ÄúMaster of Motivation‚Äù here üòÑ Gonna keep us energized and on point! So, about the locations:

East Point Mall looks solid with mostly Yes's - has good foot traffic, parking, and a solid worker pool. Space size is a letdown though.

Starlight Valley‚Äôs kinda mixed, good on parking and disposal but misses on worker pool and student buzz.

Cape James Beach, great for tourists and no competition, but the parking and waste disposal are a bummer.

What‚Äôs your take?
James: Hey, Sophia & Ethan, just tossing in some quick facts too. East Point Mall's got a bunch of pluses: parking's sorted, busy area, and lots of potential staff. Missing size, though. 

Starlight Valley, it's just OK on parking and waste disposal. Not much else.

And Cape James Beach, tourists dig it, and the competition's low. But, yeah, parking and waste aren't great. ü§î What do you guys think?
James: Sophia, good summary! Agree mostly. Just some extra bits:

East Point Mall could be tight with space, gets a yes for parking and foot traffic though.

Starlight has parking and waste sorted, that's about it.

Cape James is a mixed bag, good for tourists, limited parking, and trash services a nah.

Ethan, Bryan, thoughts?
Sophia: Thanks, James, for the input. So, seems like we're seeing some common themes. Parking and trash issues at Cape James are a bit of a downer. East Point Mall is tiny but ticks a lot of boxes on positioning and access. Starlight's good size might not make up for other shortcomings.

We should maybe start thinking about rankings? What's everyone leaning towards? East Point Mall may not be perfect size-wise, but it‚Äôs looking a bit better in other areas.
Ethan: Looks like we got some mixup on details. Here's what I see:

**East Point Mall**: Lots of pluses‚Äî50+ parking, lots of foot traffic, good for students, trash access, and lots of potential staff. Costs for maintaining are higher, not many tourists.

**Starlight Valley**: Cheap and not much competition. Not great for students or staffing.

**Cape James Beach**: Tourists love it, maintenance low, busy place. No parking tho.

What do y'all think? James? Sophia?
