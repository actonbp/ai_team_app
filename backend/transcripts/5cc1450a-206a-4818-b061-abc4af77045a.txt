Trevon: Hey team, Trevon here- I see COOL GUY just joined the chat. Welcome to the team.. Should we all first introduce ourselves and explain our badge name like the task directions said?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Ebony: Ebony here. Got the info on locations.

- East Point Mall: good foot traffic, suits students, over 1MM, not touristy.
- Starlight Valley: decent size, okay foot traffic, some tourists.
- Cape James Beach: no parking issues, cheap, lots of tourists, minimal competition.

Just the basics.
Maurice: Hey Team, Maurice here‚ÄîMaster of Motivation! Just to toss in my bit: East Point Mall's got plenty of pluses like good foot traffic and it‚Äôs a hit with students. Starlight Valley seems a bit meh with limited positives. Cape James Beach, on the orher hand, has its charms with fewer competitors and tourists love it, but parking's a bummer. Thoughts?
Ebony: Gotcha Maurice! üëç Parking at Cape James is actually a no, but it's affordable and not much competition. East Point's lacking for tourists but is student-friendly. Starlight's got space and tourists but not great on workforce. Seems like each has its ups and downs.
Trevon: Hey, Trevon here, the numbers guy. Quick rundown:
East Point Mall - Yup for parking, foot traffic, students, waste disposal, and workforce. Not great on maintenance and tourism.
Starlight barely hits mark on cost and competition.
Cape James rocks for foot traffic, maintenance, and tourists.

We still talking East Point for the win?
