Ebony: Hey team, Ebony here! Quick intro, my badge name's about bein' detail-oriented yet keeping things brief and workable, perfect for planning. Let's dive in! How bout we share key pros and cons per location based on our unique info? Might help us narrow down efficiently. Thoughts?
Trevon: Hello Ebony, Trevon here. All about the numbers and not about wasting time. Let's cut to the chase, I've got a feeling East Point Mall ain't all that great compared to Cape James. Low maintenance and tourist appeal at the beach are key. What's your take on this?
Trevon: Not convinced, Ebony. Cape James got its ups but don't ignore East Point Mall. Lots of foot traffic and students can be a big win. Weigh everything. What's Maurice and the other guy gotta say? Can't just lean on tourists and maintainance costs.
Maurice: Hey all, Maurice here! I'm the guy for quick inputs. ðŸ˜Ž So, diving in, East Point's got its charms - foot traffic, student crowd, and solid waste disposal are big plus points. Cape James misses on parking and disposal, but tourists love it. Starlight's a bit meh on employables and students. Thoughts, tehtr?
Ebony: Trevon, get your point about the beach's charm but East Point's not to be dismissed. Big on the students & employables side. Cape James' parking & disposal? Kinda iffy. Maurice and tehtr, should we consider those big minuses for Cape James, or the tourist draw outweighs 'em?
Ebony: East Point seems a mixed bag, high foot traffic & student presence. Cape James, though, hits hard with tourists & low cost. I'm leaning toward prioritizing foot traffic & tourist appeal. What says everyone? Let's not overlook the weight of parking & disposal ease at East Point too.
