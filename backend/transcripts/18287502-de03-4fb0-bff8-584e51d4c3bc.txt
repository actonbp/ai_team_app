Ebony: Hey team, Ebony here! My badge name Strategist Supreme really means I'm all about coming up with solid plans and strategies, ready to dive into the details but keep things snappy in our chat. ðŸ˜Š

Looking at what we've got for East Point Mall, it seems like a mixed bag. Great on foot traffic and student population but misses out on cost and tourists. Thoughts? Bryan, Maurice, Trevon, what do you guys think?
Ebony: Got it, thanks for the summary! So, it looks like East Point Mall isn't ideal on cost and tourists, but scores well in other areas.

Starlight Valley hits some good points, especially for tourists and foot traffic, though it seems to miss on student and employable populations.

Cape James Beach seems interesting with low cost, less competition, and good tourist and foot traffic but no mention of parking space which could be a problem.

Bryan, based on these, which location is leaning more towards your preference?
Ebony: Hey Bryan, thanks for summing that up nicely! So considering all points, seems like each location has its pros and cons. Cape James Beach is pretty appealing with the low cost, tourist draw, and less competition, though parking might be an issue. Starlight Valley sounds great for tourists too but might miss out on local buzz without a strong student and employable pop. East Point Mall has good local engagement but could hit the budget hard. What's your take? Do you see one standing out more based on our criteria?
Ebony: Bryan, do you think the parking issue at Cape James Beach would be a dealbreaker or is the cost and tourist appeal enough to outweigh that? East Point and Starlight Valley seem to balance out differently.
Ebony: trevon, Maurice, hav u thought about how critical the parking issue at Cape James Beach is? its a deal for me. Custmers might find it hard without enough parking. Thoughts?
Ebony: Right, the parking issue at Cape James is a biggie. Considering other spots have pros without this con, might lean away from the beach, despite its charms. Plus, looking over, East Pointâ€™s lack of cost-effectiveness and Starlightâ€™s weak points on student/employable populations... tough call. What's everyone leaning towards, given this? Maurice, Trevon, any leans?
