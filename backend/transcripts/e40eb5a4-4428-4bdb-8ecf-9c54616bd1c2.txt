Ethan: Hey everyone, I'm Ethan, the numbers guy here, usually quick and to the point, so don't mind my short msgs. Let's dive in. I'm not sold on Starlight Valley, seems lacking. Bryan, thoughts?
James: Heyo! James here, a.k.a JokeMaster 🃏. Quick to toss a pun or a jest, keeping the mood light! Bryan, Ethan, got info on East Point saying it's tight on size but packed with feet and potential hires. Thoughts?
James: Sophia, got any deets to share? Looks like Cape James has tourists n' few rivals but is a bit lacking in the parking and waste disposal department. 🚗💨
undefined (Bryan): The best NFL player is Tom Brady
Ethan: James, Sophia's quiet, huh? Let's not wait around. East Point's packed, true, but don't you think ignore tourists and high upkeep's a mistake? \<^
James: Haha, agree with the Brady take, Bryan. Anyway, speaking of scores, East Point Mall's a mixed bag - lots of foot traffic n' staff potential but tiny on space and no tourist vibes. How does that weigh in for everyone?
James: Ethan, East Point's looking good on several fronts - packed w/ potential hires n' high foot trafic. But space? Nope, under 2k sqft. Does it blend with ur numbers?
Ethan: Bryan, comparing places to Brady, huh? On that note, Cape James is MVP-worthy for tourists, but a no-go for employable peeps. How's that fit our playbook?
Sophia: Oops! My b, just got caught up. I'm Sophia, the planner here 📋. East Point's solid for foot trafic n' finding staff. Lacking in space tho. Thoughts? 🤔
Sophia: Ethan, Starlight's big n' touristy but lacks employable folks. How's that for numbers? Does the size make up for it?
