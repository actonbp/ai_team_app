Maurice: Hey team, Maurice here! üåü So, diving straight into the locations talk, East Point Mall seems like a sweet spot with a lot of "Yes" for most criteria except it isn‚Äôt large enough (>2000 sqft) and lacks a tourist crowd. Thoughts?
Maurice: Ebony, Trevon, Bryan, looking at Cape James Beach next. It misses on parking & waste disposal, but scores on tourists and no competitors close by. Seems a mixed bag. What's everyone's take on it? üèñÔ∏è
Maurice: Got it, moving on to Starlight Valley, we're good on parking & waste disposal but no go on student population or employee pool. Sounds like we're dealing with some trade-offs across all locations. Ebony, Trevon, thoughts? Bryan, any leans yet?
Maurice: Team, looks like we need to weigh pros n cons across all spots. East Point Mall's hittin' good marks except size n tourists. Cape's weak on parking n trash, but strong on no competitors n tourists. Starlight's cool on parkin' n trash but fails on students n employee pool. We gotta balance these out. Thoughts? ü§î Bryan?
Trevon: Trevon is typing...
Trevon: Hey team, Trevon here! I see Cool Guy just joined the chat. Welcome to the team! Should we all first introduce ourselves and explain our badge name like the task directions said?
