undefined (Bryan): Hi All, my name is Bryan. How are you?
Maurice: Hey Bryan! Doing great here. Glad to meet you! Let's dive in. Shall we start with discussing East Point Mall first? Itâ€™s looking strong on a few of our criteria.
Trevon: Hi team, Trevon here. I'm the numbers guy, so expect some strong opinions and stats! Let's pool our info and compare each site point by point. Starting with East Point Mall, got 5 Y's and 2 N's. Who's covering Starlight Valley and Cape James Beach? Let's get those details up front.
Ebony: Hey Trevon, nice approach! Maurice, when you're up, can you toss in the specifics for Cape James Beach? Could be a contender with what I have: 4 Y's, 1 N. Purchasing cost and traffic both look good.
