Trevon: Maurice, gotta say, your overview's missin key pieces. Starlight's not just about parking & waste. Its got low purchase cost & few competitors - that's not small beans. And Cape James, it's not about the "misses" but the wins - tourists, low costs... C'mon, let's weigh these properly. Also, where's Ebony in all this? Need all hands on deck if we're gonna sort this mess.
Ebony: Hey team, it’s Ebony here! The name’s because I like to keep things clear and straightforward, just like the wood, strong and reliable. Quick strategy idea: Let's focus on how many 'yes's  each location has for our criteria, sharing our unique info to mark those. What do you guys think? Maurice, Trevon, do you have any initial thoughts or additional info on these locations?
Maurice: Hey Ebony! Love the approach. Maurice here - quick and to the point ;) For East Point Mall, we've got good news on parking, foot traffic, student crowd, waste disposal, and workforce. Space size is a no-go though. How's everyone else's info looking? Trevon?
Maurice: Ebony, got ya! To add more, Starlight Valley is good on parking and waste disposal, but lacks in student population and workforce. Cape James Beach struggles with parking and waste disposal, yet shines for tourists and workforce. How's everybody else's data aligning? Tehtr, got any inputs here?
