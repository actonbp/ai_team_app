Ethan: Hey team, this is Ethan. Before we dive in, here's what I think: Let's not get stuck on one location. Keep a tally of pros and cons for each, based on our criteria. We’ve all got pieces of the puzzle. Let’s start sharing. And James, got anything on sq footage for these places? Seems critical, right?
Ethan: Square footage tho, James? Important or no? Cuz if it doesn't fit, it's a no-go. I say critical. Cap James sounds promising but size matters here. Thoughts?
