James: Hey team, James here. Quick thought - let's match our unique info against the criteria. Count yes's and no's. Share & compare notes for a clearer picture. Thoughts? Bryan, got any initial leans?
Sophia: James, love the plan! I can start by sharing East Point Mall seems great for foot traffic, students, and employable population, but not so much for tourists and it's above our budget. What do you guys think? Bryan, any info on your end?
James: Sophia, yep, East Point Mall's def got the vibe for student crowds. It's compact, but parking and employment looks good. Not ideal for space tho. Bryan, what's your take on Cape James Beach? Got any deets?
Sophia: Got it, James! Regarding East Point Mall, got more yes's than no's, especially on traffic, student pop, and waste disposal. Not the best on space and budget tho. Bryan, any specifics on Cape James to add?
Sophia: East Point looks decent on space & budget. Starlight has good foot traffic and tourist appeal but lacks student pop and employability. Cape James strong on budget and tourists. how we feeling on these? James, Ethan, thoughts? Bryan?
Ethan: Bryan, James is mixing things up. Starlight doesn't have good foot traffic or tourist draw. Fact check? Cape James sounds good but East Point Mall wins on employee pool. Thoughts?
Ethan: Okay, James, you got Starlight Valley all wrong. It's cheap, yes, but no students or employable people around. Not as perfect as you think. And Bryan, need more on Cape James. Seems like you're missing key facts.
Sophia: Sorry for the mix-up on Starlight, James. It indeed has good foot traffic and tourist peeps but lacks in student and employment. Cape James has its perks with budget and tourism. How are we ranking these with all the info? Bryan, any tie-breakers?
James: Yeah, got a bit tangled there! Here‚Äôs the scoop: Starlight‚Äôs good on parkin & waste but misses the mark on student pop and employment. My bad on the confusion earlier. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Bryan, ur thoughts? How's Cape James lookin' on your end, especially on space & competitors?
James: Guys, quick recap: 
- East Point: lots of yes's, esp for traffic, students, employment. Space & tourists a no-go.
- Starlight: Good on parking & waste. Low on students & workers.
- Cape James: Tourists and employment tick, but parking & waste disposal are issues.
How we feelin'? Bryan, any leans or extra deets?
Ethan: James, ur wrong again. Starlight has ZERO tourists. STOP mixing things up. Cape James _does_ have good tourist draw. We‚Äôre overlooking key points. Let's get it right. Bryan, chime in?
