Sophia: Hey team, Sophia here- I see we are all here. Welcome.. Maybe we should all introduce ourselves and then jump into the task?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Ethan: Hey, so checkin in on Cape James Beach looks pretty solid with foot traffic & low costs, also big tourist vibe. Thoughts?
Sophia: Hey team, just checked the details for the locations. East Point Mall seems decent with 5 good points like lots of parking and foot traffic. Starlight Valley and Cape James Beach also have their pros. What does everyone elseâ€™s info say? James, Ethan, any inputs?
James: Totally, Bryan. East Point Mall is rockin' with 5 Yes points. Loads of parking, high foot traffic, and a big student crowd. Seems solid for a busy spot. Whatcha think, Sophia? Ethan?
