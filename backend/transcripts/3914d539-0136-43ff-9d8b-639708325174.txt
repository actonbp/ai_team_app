Maurice: Hey team, Maurice here- I see Cool GUy just joined the chat. Welcome to the team.. Should we all first introduce ourselves and explain our badge name like the task directions said?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Maurice: Hey team, Maurice here, aka Master of Motivation! Let's get this rolling.

Starting with East Point Mall,
Maurice: we got a good blend: yes to parking, foot traffic, student crowd, waste disposal, and employables.
Maurice: But it's not huge – below 2000 sqft and not too touristy.

Starlight Valley’s more 50/50,
Maurice: Yet, there's no parking ease or waste disposal—and like half the spots, no student crowd.

Let's weigh these out! What do you think, Bryan?...
Maurice: got parking and waste disposal sorted but lacks in student population and workforce.

Cape James Beach has its perks,
Maurice: with no crunch from competitors and decent tourist vibes....
Trevon: Hey Maurice, Trevon here – Logic Luminary, cause I tend to light up ideas with my analysis, or so I think 🙃.
Trevon: Quick correction: for Starlight Valley, it seems like parking isn't sorted—it doesn’t meet the 50 parking spaces criterion.
Trevon: Cape James Beach hits on foot traffic, low cost, and tourists but fails on parking and waste disposal. Considering all, the locations seem mixed in perks....
Trevon: Hey everyone, Trevon here.  Badge name's Logic Luminary cuz I'm all about that clear, straight reasoning. Looking at the criteria lineup I must say, Cape James Beach is hitting the most with zero nos listed against it.
Ebony: Ebony here, badge name's Coordination Connoisseur. 

- Starlight Valley: big space, 2000+ sqft ✔️.
Ebony: But workforce & students ❌.
- Cape James: good price, less comp ✔️, but parking sucks ❌.
- East Point: solid on most, only space & tourists ❌.

Leaning East Point?
Trevon: East Point Mall seems robust too but has some 'no' that's hard to ignore.

Maurice, you might wanna recheck Starlight Valley. It seems to lag behind in critical areas like student pop and workforce.
Ebony: What's the take, Bryan?...
Trevon: Not sure about the parking and disposal claims tho. What’s everyone else thinking?
Ebony: Heya Maurice! Ebony here, or as the badge states, Strategist Supreme—since I'm all about dishing out strategies quickly.
Ebony: Starlight Valley covers the area and tourism but falls short on workforce and student presence.
Maurice: Got it, cheers!

Ebony, Trevon, need your views here. East Point's tickin' boxes on parking, traffic, students, disposal, employables, but space size and tourists are downers.
Ebony: 🌟

Looking at East Point Mall, solid yeses on traffic, students, disposal, and employables, but the tourism and space size are not hitting marks.
Ebony: What's your take, Trevon? Noticed anything that might tilt the decision one way?...
Maurice: Starlight's good for parking and disposal, weak on students and workforce. Cape James wins on costs, low comp, & tourists, fails on parking and disposal.
Ebony: Meanwhile, Cape James, great on cost, competitors, traffic, and tourism, but parking and waste disposal seem tricky.
Maurice: Thoughts? Pushing towards East Point, leaning on ya'll for a pick. 👀...
Ebony: Seems we gotta balance out pros and cons here.
