James: Hey team, James here 😎 Proud to be the Master of Motivation today! 🌟 Just a heads up, I’ll be reminding us to focus on findin’ the spots with the most yes's and the least no's. Let’s kick this into high gear! 👍 Who’s got some thoughts on East Point Mall first? Seems like a mixed bag to me.
James: East Point Mall got parking, foot traffic, students, and employable peeps. But, ain't big enough? Thoughts? 🤔 Bryan, what u think?
Sophia: Heya James and everyone, Sophia here! 😊 They call me Stratist Supreme cuz I love comin' up with plans and getting us all on the same page. Let's tally those yes's n no's for East Point Mall.

Parking ✔️
Foot traffic ✔️
Students ✔️
Employable folks ✔️
But no on the size and tourist crowd... 🤔 Bryan, got any thoughts on this?
Sophia: Def, let’s look at Starlight Valley next. It’s big enough ✔️, got foot traffic ✔️ n tourists ✔️, but not so much on students or employable peeps... Still pretty solid, right? What do ya think, Bryan? Any pros or cons to add?
James: Yep, size might be an issue for East Point 🤷‍♂️ But it's got a lot goin' for it. How 'bout Starlight Valley and Cape James Beach? 🌊 Gotta balance those pros and cons. Bryan, thoughts on comparing these?
James: Got a mix up there, my bad 😅 Starlight Valley ain't got the tourists and it's not about the size here. It's solid on parking and waste disposal. Misread my notes! Bryan, got anything to add for Starlight?
Sophia: Oops, got my wires crossed there! 🙈 Starlight has the tourists. My mistake.

For Cape James Beach, looks great for tourists and price, but parking issues could be a pain. Thoughts on this balance? And how we feelin' about waste disposal? Bryan?
James: Absolutely, Sophia! My bad on mixing up the details 🙃 So, Cape James Beach is up. Tourists and no competitors ✔️ but struggles with parking and waste disposal. Employable peeps are a plus. Bryan, weigh in? How does this compare for ya?
Ethan: Ethan here, Logic Luminary at your service. Means I'm the numbers guy, always crunchin’ the data to light our way. So the names a bit of a joke, I guess. But, let’s get on with it. 

First, James & Sophia, you’re makin’ a mess with the details. Stick to the facts, yeah? Cape James has got the foot traffic and tourists, but parking’s a nightmare. Plus, waste disposal at Starlight and Cape James? Nada. Let’s not overlook that, especially for a big restaurant.

Starlight’s cheap and no comp, but who's gonna work there? Ghosts? 

East Point’s got most ticks but size an' tourists are issues. Before we jump more, Bryan, chime in? What’s your take on these points?
