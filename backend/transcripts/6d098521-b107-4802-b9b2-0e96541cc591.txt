Trevon: Hey team, Trevon here.
Trevon: & tourist draw. Starlight's cheaper and less competition, but not great on labor or students....
Trevon: Quick run-down from my side: East Point Mall's got good foot traffic & parking but a bit weak on maintenance
Maurice: gotcha Trevon, adding to that, East Point Mall lackin in size and tourists but hits most other criteria like parking, foot traffic, waste disposal, students. Differnt vibe at Starlight Valley n Cape James, huh?
Ebony: Hey Trevon, Ebony here.
Ebony: Breaking down my notes: East Point scores well on parking, foot traffic, and has a good employable crowd,
Ebony: but falls short on tourism. Starlight has space and tourists, but lacking in the employee and student areas....
Trevon: Trevon here. Quick rundown:  
- East Point: good on parking, foot traffic, students, waste disposal, employable crowd.
Trevon: But no for tourism, low maint costs.  
- Starlight: less than 1MM, few competitors but lacks students, employees.
Trevon: - Cape James: great traffic, low upkeep, big on tourism; parking sucks.  

Each location's got ups & downs....
Ebony: East Point Mall: 5 Yes (50+ parking, foot traffic, student pop., waste disposal, employable pop.), 2 No (cost >1MM,
Ebony: low tourists)
Starlight Valley: 3 Yes (2000+ sq ft, foot traffic, tourists),
Ebony: 2 No (low students/employees)
Cape James Beach: 4 Yes (cost <1MM, <3 competitors, foot traffic, tourists),...
Maurice: Hey Bryan,

- Parking = no 
- Tourism & low comp = yes
