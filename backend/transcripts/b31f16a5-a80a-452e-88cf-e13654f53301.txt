Trevon: Just a heads up, they're calling me "Logic Luminary" because I'm good at making sense of numbers and data quickly — help keep our logic on track.
Trevon: Starting off with what I know: East Point Mall seems decent with a lot of "Yes" but those "No" on maintenance and tourists might be an issue.
Trevon: Starlight Valley's weak on the employee and student side. Cape James Beach, though, all green on my end! How's it looking from everyone else's angle?...
