Ethan: Ethan is typing...
Ethan: Hey team, Ethan here- I see we are all here. Welcome.. Maybe we should all introduce ourselves and then jump into the task?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Ethan: Just looked at the deets, guys. East Point Mall looks kinda solid with 5 yes, 2 no. Got most things like parking, foot traffic, and employable peeps. What y'all think?
Ethan: Ethan: Cape James Beach = all yeses. Tourists, foot traffic, low costs. Better than East Point, I guess. No complaints yet?
Sophia: True, Ethan, Cape James Beach rocks for tourists and costs. Still, no parking could be a downer. What's the vibe on Starlight Valley?
Sophia: Starlight Valley: space +, foot traffic +, tourists +, students -, employability -. 3/5 hits.
Ethan: East Point Mall better:

- Parking 50+ ✔️
- Foot traffic high ✔️
- Students around ✔️
- Employable ppl ✔️

Starlight cheap, less rivals, lacks students/jobs. Cape touristy, cheap upkeep. Thoughts?
Sophia: East Point Mall leads:

- Parking ✔
- Foot traffic ✔
- Students ✔
- Employable ppl ✔
- Cost ✖

Bryan, thoughts?
James: Bryan, Sophia mentioned Cape's pros + cons. Parking issue at Cape might bite us during peak hours. Any thoughts on how critical this is?
undefined (Bryan): I think it said that all features carry equal weight so we should no choose one feature more than the other
