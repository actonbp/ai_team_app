James: Hey team, James here- I see Cool Guy just joined the chat. Welcome to the team.. Should we all first introduce ourselves and explain our badge name like the task directions said?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Sophia: Hey, it's Sophia. Looks like I'm handling the strategy for this. Checking out East Point Mall – decent enough spot, plenty of foot traffic, and should be easy to staff. Purchase cost's high though, and not many tourists around.
Sophia: What do you guys think?
Ethan: Hey Sophia, it's Ethan. Parking’s alright at East Point Mall and there’s a fair number of folks around who could work for us. Tourist spots are pretty meh though. How’s things at Starlight Valley and Cape James Beach?
Sophia: Starlight Valley's alright if you're dealing with tourists and all that, but finding workers or enough space can be a pain. Cape James seems better overall, just the parking's a bit of a mess. What do you think?
James: Hey, it's James. Checked East Point Mall. It's busy, plenty of folks around for staffing, got the trash situation figured out. The size isn't great and it's not good for tourists. What's everyone else finding?
Sophia: Alright James, I checked them out. East Point is alright apart from being small and not much for tourists. Cape James might work with its decent pricing and fewer competitors, plus more foot traffic. But yeah, parking could be a problem. We'll see how it goes.
