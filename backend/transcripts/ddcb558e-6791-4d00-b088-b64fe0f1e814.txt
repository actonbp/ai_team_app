Maurice: Hey team, I see Cool guy just joined the chat. Welcome to the team.. Should we all first introduce ourselves and explain our Title/badge name like the directions said?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Trevon: Hey everyone, Trevon here. Just a quick intro as Logic Luminary, basically means I light the way with clear thinking, just love making things make sense, you know.

So, about the locations, East Point Mall's kinda mixed, good for parking, foot traffic, waste disposal, and has some employable peeps around. But maintenance and tourism aren't great. What’s everybody else got?
Ebony: Hey everyone, I'm Ebony, aka Strategist Supreme. I’m all about good, detailed plans but like keeping things simple and short here. 

So, East Point Mall hits 5/10 criteria: good parking, foot traffic, student pop, waste disposal, and employable peeps. But cost and tourism are downsides. 

Starlight Valley hits 3/5 I've got: good size, foot traffic, and tourists.
Ebony: But lacking students and nearby employees.

Cape James Beach hits 4/5: decent cost, limited competitors, good foot traffic, and touristy but not great for parking. 

Whaddya all think so far?
Maurice: Hey, Maurice here. They call me Master of Motivation, cuz I keep things movin' and groovin'.

Adding to my stuff:
- East Point Mall: Good for parking, foot traffic, students, waste disposal, and employable folks. Lacks proper size and tourists.
- Starlight Valley: Good parking and waste disposal.
Maurice: Bad for students and employees.
- Cape James Beach: Good for low competition, tourists, and employable folks. Bad parking, students, and waste disposal.

Holla Bryan, what's your take?
Trevon: Not sure if we got Bryan's input yet. But to keep it simple, looks like East Point Mall ticks more boxes overall except for cost and tourism.

Maurice, you mentioned Cape James Beach is bad for waste disposal and students. Dunno' if that's the case, I've got good foot traffic, low maintain costs, and tourists.

Ebony, what do you think about Cape James after seeing my info?

Bryan, you there?
Ebony: Hey everyone. Ebony here, aka Strategist Supreme. Let’s get into it.

From my info:
- **East Point Mall**: Y parking, foot traffic, students, waste disposal, employable folks. N cost and tourism. 
- **Starlight Valley**: Y size, foot traffic, tourists. N students, employees.
- **Cape James Beach**: Y cost, low competition, foot traffic, tourists.
Ebony: N parking.

Seems like we're getting a lot covered. Bryan, what do you have for us?
Maurice: Yo Maurice here, quick sum up:

- **East Point Mall**: 5Y, 2N
- **Starlight Valley**: 2Y, 2N
- **Cape James Beach**: 3Y, 3N

East Point Mall wins. 

Bryan?
Maurice: Maurice here. Let's not rank yet. Waiting for Bryan's input.

Ebony:

- **Starlight Valley** good for parking, waste disposal. Bad for students, employees. 
- **Cape James Beach** bad for parking, students, waste disposal. Good for tourists, low competition, employable.

Sum info up again before ranking? 

Maurice out.
Trevon: Ok, let's sum up quickly what we have then decide.
- **East Point Mall**: 5 Y - parking, foot traffic, students, waste disposal, employable. 2 N - cost, tourism.
- **Starlight Valley**: 2 Y - cost, limited competitors. 2 N - students, employees.
- **Cape James Beach**: 3 Y - foot traffic, low maint., tourists. 0 N.

It's looking like East Point got most Ys but also has a few Nos.
Trevon: Cape James solid but less info. Maurice, anything else on Starlight Valley? And Bryan, any info to complete the puzzle?
Maurice: - **East Point Mall**: ✔️ parking, foot traffic, students, waste, employees. ❌ size, tourists
- **Starlight Valley**: ✔️ parking, waste. ❌ students, employees
- **Cape James Beach**: ✔️ tourists, low comp, employees. ❌ parking, students, waste

East Point seems ahead. Bryan, tie-breaker info?
undefined (Bryan): Yes, I have EPM 1 and waht about the 2nd and 3rd ranking?
Ebony: Yo, Ebony here again.

To tally up:

- **East Point Mall**: 5Y (parking, foot traffic, students, waste disposal, employees), 2N (cost, tourists)
- **Starlight Valley**: 3Y (size, foot traffic, tourists), 2N (students, employees)
- **Cape James Beach**: 4Y (cost, low competition, foot traffic, tourists), 1N (parking)

East Point: Most Ys but cost and tourism are issues.
Trevon: Ok wrapping up:

1. **EPT 1st**: 5Y (parking, foot traffic, students, waste disposal, employees), 2N (cost, tourists)
2. **CJB 2nd**: 4Y (cost, low comp, foot traffic, tourists), 1N (parking)
3. **SV 3rd**: 3Y (size, foot traffic, tourists), 2N (students, employees)

Done.
Ebony: Cape James: Good balance but lacking a bit in criteria. 

Let’s hear from Bryan to wrap this up!
undefined (Bryan): Yes, I agree with this
