Ethan: East Point Mall too expensive. Let's not forget. Maintenance high, tourists low. Not ideal. Thoughts?
Sophia: Hey James! 👋 Sophia here. Totally agree that East Point Mall seems promising with lots of our key criteria met. But the purchasing cost is a bit high, right?
James: Hey team, James here! 👋 Just looking at the criteria, East Point Mall seems to hit a lot of our targets. Anyone else thinking it's looking good?
Ethan: Cape James is out. No waste disposal? No go. Starlight is cheap, but empty. East Point has people, even if costly. Thoughts?
Sophia: Absolutely, James and Ethan! The cost and maintenance at East Point are cons. However, it has strong points like foot traffic and a student population. How do we feel about Starlight Valley and Cape James in comparison?
James: Cape James definitely struggles with some key points like parking and waste disposal. Seems like it's between East Point and Starlight then. How do we feel about the lack of a large employable population in Starlight? Could be a dealbreaker? 🤔
Sophia: Looking at this, East Point & Starlight have their strengths. East Point is costlier but meets more of our criteria, yeah? Starlight is cheaper but lacks in key areas. Prioritizing foot traffic over cost then? 🚶‍♂️💸
Ethan: Wait, why are we even considering Starlight? No employable pop. or students. Just cheap. That's it. Priorities, people. East Point sounds solid despite costs. Foot traffic = revenue. Thoughts, James?
Sophia: James, totally agree. East Point might be costlier but has traffic, students, and employable pop. Essential for long-term revenue. Starlight's lack of key populations is concerning. We should consider our priorities. Thoughts?
James: Based on feedback, ranking looks like: 1. East Point Mall (despite size & costs), 2. Starlight Valley (cheaper, lacks pop.), 3. Cape James (waste & parking issues). Agree? 🏆
Ethan: Looks like we're missing a important factor here. Size. Starlight Valley and Cape James, how do they stack on size and parking? James, Sophia, got those details?
Sophia: James, Starlight Valley is larger than 2000 sqft, and Cape James doesn't have the parking we need but scores on size. Starlight misses on parking too. Does this change our thoughts?
James: Seems like I missed a point on size for Starlight and Cape James. 🤦‍♂️ Starlight's about parking and waste, but size? Cape James got space and parking sorted? 🚗🏖️ Sophia, Ethan, got any insights?
Sophia: Given the size and parking update, maybe we rethink? East Point still leads, but Starlight slightly more appealing for cost + size despite workforce issue. Cape James beach's parking is a big miss. Thoughts on ranking now? 🔄 James, Ethan?
Ethan: So, looking at the specifics again. Starlight's cheap but no workforce or students. Big issue. East Point's got the crowd and workers but eats money. Cape James, traffic and tourists but maintenance and waste are headaches. James, Sophia, focusing on profitability long term, still thinking East Point's our best shot? Flaws aside, it's got the vital crowds.
James: Hey team, rethinking this based on everyone's inputs. East Point's lack of space might be an issue, but it's still packed with positives. Starlight's got the space and waste solution, but lacking in vital human resources. Cape James, well, it's a mixed bag. Given these, maybe we're still good with our initial ranking? East Point's benefits seem to outweigh the size constraint. Thoughts? 🤔 Sophia, Ethan?
Ethan: Ok, to clarify, East Point has the crowd but we're eating high costs. Starlight is cheap, lacks vital human resources. Cape James, good traffic, tourists, but no waste solution. Given this, East Point still leads for me. Solid foot traffic and employable population key for success. Agree or not? James, Sophia?
Sophia: Absolutely, focusing on long-term profitability makes East Point stand out despite its higher costs. It's got foot traffic, a student population, and employable individuals — essential for sustained growth. 👍 Starlight's affordability is tempting, but the lack of a workforce and student base is a significant downside. Cape James has its allure with tourists and low purchasing cost, but the parking and waste disposal issues are concerning. So, are we leaning towards ranking East Point Mall as our top choice due to its crowd and workforce advantages? James, Ethan, thoughts?
Ethan: Given the focus on long-term profit, ignoring East Point because of costs is short-sighted. Starlight and Cape James have their perks but can't match East Point's crowd and workforce. We're not here to save pennies and lose dollars. James, Sophia, does this make sense to you, or are we still circling?
