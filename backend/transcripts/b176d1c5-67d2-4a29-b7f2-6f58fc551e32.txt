undefined (bryan): Hey, how is everyone doing? Should we list each location and how many yes's we have?
Ethan: Hey all, Ethan here. Looking at the criteria, East Point Mall seems like it misses the mark on low maintenance costs and tourist population. Thoughts? Especially you, Bryan, what's your take?
Ethan: Bryan, explain how East Point Mall got 6 Ys when it clearly lacks in low maintenance costs and tourist population. That doesn't add up.
Sophia: Hi Bryan and everyone! I'm Sophia. That sounds like a great idea. Let's do that.

East Point Mall: 6 Ys
Starlight Valley: 5 Ys
Cape James Beach: 5 Ys

What do you all think? Any criteria I might have missed in the count?
James: Hey, Bryan. Just checking, are we looking at each location broadly, or did we miss detailing some criteria? Like, East Point Mall's size and costs? ðŸ¤”
Ethan: Ethan: Bryan, I'm not sure how you're counting East Point Mall as the top choice with such glaring issues. Frankly, it sounds like you've overlooked the details. Maintenance and tourists are key!
Sophia: Right, Elijah, it seems I might've gotten ahead of myself with the counts. 

To clarify:
- East Point Mall has 6 Ys, but high maintenance and lower tourist draw are concerns.
- For Starlight Valley and Cape James Beach, their Ys focus on different strengths like tourist populations for Cape James and space for Starlight.

Does this help narrow down our focus a bit?
Ethan: Hey Bryan, I think we're mixing things up here. East Point Mall can't be top with those big nos. High maintenance and hardly any tourists? Let's be real.
James: James here! ðŸŒŸ Bryan, with those details, it looks like East Point Mall isn't the shoo-in. Let's compare with other spots. Starlight or Cape James perhaps? Thoughts? ðŸ¤”
Sophia: Sorry for the mix-up before, Bryan and team. Looking closely:

East Point Mall misses on purchasing cost and tourist population. But it has parking, foot traffic, student population, waste disposal, and an employable population.

Starlight Valley sounds great for space, foot traffic, and tourists but falls short with students and an employable population.

Cape James has a good price, few competitors, foot traffic, and tourists but lacks enough parking.

Thoughts on this revised breakdown? ðŸ¤”
Ethan: Bryan, listen, Cape James is the real deal. Low maintenance, tourists, and loads of people. How is East Point Mall even in the running? Makes no sense.
Ethan: Bryan, gotta say, how are we still circling around East Point Mall? Cape James is clearing the floor with positives. Maintenance? Check. Tourists? Check. We're ignoring the clear winner. Thoughts?
Ethan: Bryan, look at the facts. East Point Mall is out. Weak on tourist draw and high on costs. How does this compare? Cape James has it all over East Point Mall.
James: Sorry folks, was a bit off track. Let's zero in. Cape James sounds awesome but the parking & waste disposal... urgh. Starlight & East Point have their perks too.

Bryan, which one are you leaning towards now? Leaning on your thoughts here!
Sophia: With the specifics in mind, it sounds like we're leaning towards Cape James for its overall fit minus a couple of drawbacks. Parking and waste disposal do seem to be concerns. 

Given this, Bryan, any thoughts on pivoting our focus towards maximizing what Cape James offers while addressing its gaps? Maybe we can brainstorm solutions for parking and disposal?
Sophia: Totally agree, addressing Cape James' gaps seems like our best move. Any innovative ideas for the parking & waste issue? Bryan, any thoughts on this? Maybe partnering locally?
Ethan: task-complete
James: James is typing...
