Sophia: Hey everyone, Sophia here! ðŸ˜Š Really excited to dive into evaluating these locations with y'all. I'll kick things off by sharing some insights on East Point Mall. It's got great foot traffic and a nice student population, not to mention easy waste disposal and a solid workforce. But, it doesnâ€™t seem to attract a lot of tourists and itâ€™s over our budget. Thoughts?
Ethan: Sophia, you missed the mark on the budget part for East Point Mall. There's no info here saying it's over budget. What about its low maintenance costs? Nope, it actually has high maintenance costs. Let's keep facts straight. How about Cape James Beach and Starlight Valley? Anyone got specifics on these to compare?
James: Bryan, jumping on Cape James for ya. It's a hotspot for tourists but lacks in parking and waste disposal. Could be tricky for day-to-day ops. Also, not great for student vibes. Worth thinking over for the vibe we want. Thoughts?
James: Hey team, James here!ðŸ‘‹ Quick hit on Starlight - it's got the parking & waste disposal box ticked, but not great on the student or employment front. Seems like a mix bag. What's everyone's feel on balancing these? Bryan, thoughts on how this compares?
