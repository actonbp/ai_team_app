Ebony: Hey team, I'm Ebony, and as Strategist Supreme, I‚Äôm all about diving into the details to draft plans that make sense. Let's crack these location options down! 

Loking at East Point Mall, it seems pretty solid except for the cost and lack of tourists. Thoughts?
Ebony: Hey Bryan, Maurice, and Trevon, Ebony here! üåü Strategist Supreme means I love diving into details and crafting solid plans out of them. About East Point Mall, it's got a lot going for it, but yeah, the cost issue and not much tourism could be a snag. Does Cape James Beach's tourist appeal and cost make it more enticing, despite fewer parking options? What do you all think?
Ebony: True, Maurice! Starlight Valley's lack of student and employable pop might be tricky for staffing. Cape James tho, cheaper and touristy but parking's a pain. Maybe the high foot traffic compensates? How's everyone leaning?
Maurice: Hey Bryan! Maurice here üòÑ Let's dive into these details! Given the criteria, Starlight Valley seems to miss on the student and employable population front. That's a bit worrying for long-term staffin, don't ya think? What's your take on this?
Ebony: Yeah, parking at Cape James is def a downside, but tourists and cost kinda make it tempting. Esp if foot traffic's solid. Maybe it's about finding the right balance? How essential do you guys think parking is vs. tourism and cost?
Maurice: Ebony, parking at Cape James sounds tough. üò¨ But tourists and cost probs balance it out. We should weigh how vital parking is compared to the other perks? What's your pov?
Maurice: Ebony, Trevon, let's make parking a bit less priority? Cape James' tourism could boost us big time. Thoughts, Bryan?
Ebony: Considering those points, maybe we should pivot towards tourism and cost, putting parking lower on the prio list. Cape James' appeal as a tourist spot's a big plus, esp with lower cost. Might outweigh the parking issue. Bryan, do you agree? Lower priority on parking, focus on tourism and cost benefits at Cape James?
Ebony: Hmm, good point on the waste disposal at Cape James. The trade-off might be worth it given the low cost and high tourist draw. Parking lower on the list might work out. And yep, not much competition there too. Thoughts on trade-offs? Bryan, parking less of a priority for you too?
Maurice: Cape James Beach sounds like a hot spot for tourists, which is huge. Plus, not much comp there, right? üèñÔ∏è But the waste disposal issue... might be a prob. Ebony, what you think? Worth trade-off? Bryan, agree on parking not top prio?
