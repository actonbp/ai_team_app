Trevon: Hey team, Trevon here. Numbers are my game and patience isn't, so let's cut to the chase. I'm your analytical guy, direct and not here to sugarcoat. Gonna lay it out straight - we need a solid strategy. Quick reminder, let's not focus just on one spot. Need to keep a tally on the yes's and no's for each attribute, and dont forget, we gotta share all our unique bits of info to get this right. Maurice, Ebony, dhdhd, got anything to add? Let’s start this off with East Point Mall, what're y’all thinking?
Trevon: Look, focusing on East Point Mall first, it's got a lot of "Y"s which is good, but ignoring the tourist crowd might be a big miss. Low maintenance is a "N", so that's a thumbs down from me. Maurice, Ebony, what's your take on these points? dhdhd, got any insights that might sway this?
Ebony: Hey, it's Ebony here. Just to throw my badge into the ring, I'm all for working together and getting strategizing done effectively. Agree with Trevon's approach on sharing. As for East Point Mall, from wgat I'v got, the lack of a tourist population def is a minus, but it ticks boxes for parking, foot traffic, student pop, waste disposal, and employable folk. Missing the tourist crowd could be a hiccup, but those 'Y's are strong points. Thoughts, Maurice, dhdhd?
