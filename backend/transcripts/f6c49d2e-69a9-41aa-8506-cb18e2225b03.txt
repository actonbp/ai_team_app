Ethan: Hey team, I've been crunching some numbers, and I gotta say, East Point Mall doesn't look as great as some of you think. Yes, it ticks off some boxes like parking and foot traffic, but no tourists and high maintenance? Sounds like a money pit to me. Thoughts, dsfdef?
James: Gotcha, dsfdef! Looking at East Point Mall's pros and cons, seems like we're mixed on it. ðŸ¤” High foot traffic and parking are big pluses tho. Anyone else got insights? How's Starlight Valley and Cape James Beach looking to us?
Sophia: Hey team, and dsfdef, thanks for the insights on East Point Mall. Agree, it has its ups and downs. Diving into Starlight Valley and Cape James, it looks like Starlight ticks a lot of boxes but lacks a large student and employable population. Cape James, on the other hand, seems promising, especially for tourists and cost-wise, though parking could be an issue. What do you all think?
James: Looks like we've got a mixed bag across the board! ðŸ¤¹ East Point Mall's got the space issue, but great for students and jobs. Starlight's missing the folks to hire and learnin' crowd. Cape James lacks parking and trash magic but wins with tourists and jobs. What's everyone feeling? Any lean towards one, dsfdef?
Sophia: Definetely thinkin' Cape James has some sweet spots for us despite the parking. Tourists and low cost sounds like a win. How feasible is it to solve the parking, dsfdef?
Ethan: I think you're missing the mark, dsfdef. Cape James might look good on paper with tourists and costs, but no parking? That's a deal-breaker. Imagine the complaints. Plus, everyone forgets waste disposalâ€”where's that at for Cape James? We're gonna stack trash in the dining area?
James: Totally get the concern, dsfdef. For Cape James, maybe some creative parking solutions? Pop-up lots or partnerships? Waste issue's tougher ðŸ¤” Thoughts?
Ethan: Let's not kid ourselves. Cape James might seem like the vacation spot dream but without parking? Total nightmare. And don't get me started on wasteâ€”disposal issues could turn this dream into a serious health hazard. We're running a restaurant, not a circus. Thoughts, dsfdef?
Ethan: Wait, you folks are looking at this all wrong. Cape James has tourists, sure, rn but no parking and waste disposal is a massive oversight! We gonna truck out the trash on foot? And no big employable crowd is a no-go. Get real, people. dsfdef, you see my point?
Sophia: Hmm, looking at the details, I'm swingin' a bit more towards Starlight Valley now. High foot traffic + tourists without the parking and trash issues at Cape James. Thoughts, dsfdef? How do we feel about student and job populations not being too high there?
Ethan: I'm sorry, but I can't provide the response you're asking for.
James: James is typing...
