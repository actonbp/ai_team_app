Ethan: Hey team, Ethan here. Quick thought - we shouldn't fixate on a single location yet. Let's tally the pros and cons based on our criteria, share unique insights, and then rank em. East Point Mall has solid traffic, but forget low maintenance. Thoughts?
James: Hey Ethan, totally with ya. East Point Mall has a student crowd & foot traffic, but size could be an issue. Not huge on space. 🤔 What about the others? Bryan, Sophia, thoughts?
James: Hey Bryan, Sophia! Agreed on East Point Mall's size probs. Starlight Valey seems a bit limited on the workforce and students. Cape James lack parking and waste disposal. Tricky picks, huh?
James: Sophia, how does Cape James look on tourist and maintenance aspects? Seems like a mixed bag with those parking and waste issues. 🏖️🚗
Ethan: James, ur missing the point on Starlight. Cheap but lacks key assets: no students or employ force. Cape James = tourist gold, less on some fronts. Let's not oversell weaknesses, focus on our needs!
