Maurice: Hey team, Maurice here, aka Master of Motivation! To me, it's all about keeping the spirits up and steering us towards success with a bit of humor and tons of energy. Let's nail this task!

Looking at these locations, starting with East Point Mall, we've got good parking, solid foot traffic, and a strong student presence, along with quick waste disposal and a large employable population. But, it's not over 2000 sqft. Thoughts? ü§î
Ebony: Hey Maurice! Ebony here, I'm dubbed Strategist Supreme cause I‚Äôm all about crafting those detailed plans and strategies that help guide our team to victory. Super excited to dive into this with y'all!

Echoing what u said, East Point Mall is lookin pretty solid except for the size and purchasing cost. It seems to hit a lot of our marks otherwise. How about Starlight Valley? It's big enough and has got great foot traffic and tourist draw, but not much in terms of a student population or employable folks around. Whatcha think?
Ebony: True, Maurice. Starlight's lack of a student crowd & workforce could put us at a slight disadvantage, despite the size and tourist perks. Then there‚Äôs Cape James Beach. It's got a good price point, fewer competitors, awesome foot traffic, and tourists. Missing on parking though. It‚Äôs a mix with each, huh? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Ebony: Cape James kinda balances it out with its perks, despite missing on parking. Interesting how each location has its strengths and weaknesses. We should tally up the yes's and no's for each based on our criteria to see which ones come out on top overall. What's everyone's view on this approach?
Maurice: I'm all in for tallying up! Helps us see the big picture clearer without gettin' lost in the details. Let's keep in mind, no single feature outshines the others, gotta balance our picks. How's everyone's tally lookin'? Ebony, Trevon, Bryan, got numbers to share?
undefined (Bryan): I have 5 yes's and 2 no's for east point mall; 2 nos ans 1 yes for starlight, and 4 yes's and 3 no's for cape james. What about you guys?
