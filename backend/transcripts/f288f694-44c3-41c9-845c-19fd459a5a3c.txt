Ethan: Hey everyone, Ethan here. Let's cut to the chase. East Point Mall seems decent with parking, foot traffic, student pop, waste disposal, and employability but falls short on maint. costs and tourists. Starlight Valley is cheap and with fewer competitors but lacks on student pop and workforce. Cape James hits it with foot traffic, low costs, and tourists. Seems like a mixed bag tbh. Thoughts?
Ethan: James, what's your take on the space requirement for each location? Didn't hear squat about that yet. It's crutial.
James: Bryan, on the space req, East Point Mall is a no-go, under 2k sqft. Starlight Valley and Cape James info's MIA on that, gotta look at other perks. Thoughts on how these stack up taking space into account?
Sophia: Hey team, Sophia here! Jumpin' in with some space deets. Starlight Valley's the only spot hittin' the over 2000 sqft mark. So, if size’s big for us, SV's got an edge. Cape James sounds solid on cost and no nearby competition, but lacks parking. East Point’s balanced, except for no cheap buy-in. Tricky to balance, huh? Thoughts?
