Ebony: Hey everyone, I'm Ebony. For East Point Mall we've got decent ticks like 50+ parking spots, good foot traffic, and itâ€™s good for student crowd too. Also solid on waste disposal and employable folks around there. Only downsides are the purchasing cost and not much for tourists. What do you guys think?
Trevon: Hey Ebony, sounds like you got most of the details right for East Point Mall. But it's not just purchasing cost that's an issue, maintenance costs are high too. Not super ideal for tourists.
Maurice: Hey Maurice here! Looks like East Point Mall isn't too shabby, eh? Good spot for students and tons of parking. Not so great for the tourist crowd though. What's the scoop on Starlight Valley and Cape James Beach from you guys?
