Ebony: Hey everyone! I'm Ebony.ðŸ˜Š Just so everyone knows, my badge name means I'm all about diving deep and getting stuff planned out. Super keen to work with you all! Let's get started on this. How are we feeling about East Point Mall with that parking and student population? Seems good on a few fronts to me.
Ebony: Oops, sorry for the confusion there! ðŸ˜… Jumped in a bit too early. But yeah, East Point Mall has some good points. Parking and student crowd sound like a win. What does everyone think about the lack of a large tourist population there? Does it weigh heavily on our decision?
Trevon: Name's Trevon. Before I go any further, just know I'm all about the numbers. Not here to make friends, but get things straight. Ebony, focusing on tourists for East Point Mall is missing the bigger picture. It has good parking, foot traffic, and a student population. That's critical for a restaurant, no? What about waste disposal and employable folks? They matter too.
