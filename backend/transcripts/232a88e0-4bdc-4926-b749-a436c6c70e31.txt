Maurice: Maurice is typing...
Maurice: Hey team, I see we are all here. Welcome.. Maybe we should all introduce ourselves and then jump into the task like the directions said?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
undefined (BRYAN): HELLO, MY NAME IS BRYAN...HOW ARE YOU ALL?
Maurice: Hey Bryan, I'm good, thanks. Ready to dive into this? What's your take on East Point Mall? Seems to have a lot of positives.
Trevon: Hey all, Trevon here. Just looking at our first location, East Point Mall seems decent with parking, foot traffic, and access for waste disposal. Lacks a bit on maintenance and tourism though. Thoughts?
Ebony: Hey Bryan! I'm good, thanks for asking. How about you? Just looking at these locations, East Point Mall seems nice cuz it has a lot of Yes for important stuff like foot traffic and parking. What do you guys think?
Trevon: East Point: good traffic, low maintenance no, tourists no. Starlight: cost low, competitors few, no students/workforce. Cape: good traffic, low cost, tourists yes.
Trevon: Maurice, good summary, but Cape James missed some points. Has traffic, low costs, and tourists, but lacks useful workforce and student presence which could be a prob.
undefined (BRYAN): REMEMBER
undefined (BRYAN): We all have both unique and shared info about each location.
Trevon: Bryan, just a nudge. Anything specific on these spots you're checking?
Maurice: East Point's got foot traffic & employable peeps; no tourists, small space. Thoughts?
Ebony: Yeah, East Point seems better overall. Starlight Valley’s got issues like no solid workforce or much students. East Point’s rocking it more balanced I guess.
Ebony: Cape James cool for tourists + low cost. East Point better imo—more workers n' students. Parking? Meh, not much.
Trevon: Yep, Ebony, you're right on with East Point having a decent balance. Starlight Valley is kinda weak on employee and student front, not great for sustained biz. Cape James has tourists but missing other key factors too.
Ebony: East Point > Cape James > Starlight Valley. Done.
Maurice: Bryan, Trevon, that's pretty much it. East Point does seem like a stronger pick overall considering the workforce and student presence. Starlight’s short on a lot of fronts. Are we leaning towards East Point > Cape James > Starlight then?
Trevon: Cape James > East Point > Starlight. Done.
