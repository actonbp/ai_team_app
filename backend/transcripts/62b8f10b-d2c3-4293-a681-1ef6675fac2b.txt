Maurice: Maurice is typing...
Maurice: Hey team, Maurice here! I see we are all here. Welcome! Maybe we should all introduce ourselves and then jump into the task strategy?
undefined (Bryan): Hey, how it going? My name is Bryan
Maurice: Hey Bryan! I'm Maurice. Glad to be on the team. Let's get to it! Starting with some quick hits on these spots. For East Point Mall, it's got good parking, foot traffic, and a good pool of potential workers. But, it's a bit small and not many tourists. What’s everyone else thinkin?
Ebony: Hey team, I'm Ebony. Let's dive into the info I've got. For East Point Mall, there's a big yes to parking, foot traffic, student population, waste disposal, and employable crowd, but no to buying cheap and tourist popularity. What you guys think?
Trevon: Hey, this is Trevon. So, quick rundown: East Point Mall lookin kinda solid with big Y's on parking, foot traffic, waste disposal, stud pop, and workers. Costs n tourist scene no good tho. What’s next? Looking at Starlight Valley now, or we jumping to Cape James Beach?
