Trevon: Hey team, Trevon here- I see Cool guy just joined the chat. Welcome to the team.. Should we all first introduce ourselves and explain our badge name like the task directions said?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Maurice: Hey, just here to get through this. For East Point Mall, got 5 yeses, solid student crowd, decent foot traffic, but small and not many tourists. That's it.
Trevon: Yeah, East Point Mall isnâ€™t bad but the lack of tourists could hurt. Cape James is hitting all the right notes though. uy fot traffic, low maintence, and tourists all lined up, looks promsing. What do you make of it, Maurice?
Trevon: Hey, I'm Trevon, just clocking in for this quick task. My badge name 'Logic Luminary' is just a fancy way of saying I'm good at picking apart details and brightening up the underlying logic in our discussions. Looking at the criteria,
Trevon: East Point Mall sounds decent with lots of yeses except for maintenance and tourist traffic. Cape James Beach is scoring high with no nos. What do
Trevon: y'all think? Maurice, any thoughts on Starlight Valley?
Ebony: Ebony here. Got the 'Strategist Supreme' badge, means I line things up, strategize. Starlight Valley's big, good traffic but low on students/workers. Cape James is better - good costs, competitors, traffic, tourists but bad parking. That's what's up.
Trevon: Maurice, actually Cape James ticks off the boxes we need, parking and waste are fine. It's solid for tourists and upkeep too. Just listing the pros and cons to keep track.
