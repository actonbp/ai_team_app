Ebony: Hey team, Ebony here! 🔑 My badge means I'm geared up to strategize and get things moving with our task. I suggest we start by listing key "Y" or "N" for each location based on the criteria we've got. Let's break it down one by one. I'll kick off with East Point Mall! 

- 50 parking spaces: Y
- Substantial foot traffic: Y
- Student population: Y
- Waste disposal access: Y
- Employable population: Y

Purchasing cost and tourist population don't hit the mark here. Thoughts? How do these stack up with info you guys have?
Trevon: Name's Trevon, here to stir the pot. My badge? Analytical genius, but not here to make friends. Bryan, Maurice, don't mess it up. 

Let's get real, East Point Mall's missing key perks. Low maintenance? N. Big tourist vibe? N. Cape James, on the flipside, ticks these boxes. Low cost upkeep, tourist central. Starlight? Cheap, sure, but dead for student and worker appeal. Thoughts? Ebony, Maurice, Bryan, got counterpoints?
Maurice: Ebony, spot on start! 👍 For East Point Mall, yep, no big space (>2000 sqft) though. Adds up with what you got. Moving to Starlight Valley - got some Ys and Ns:

- Parking: Y
- Waste disposal: Y
- Student pop & employable folks: N

Kind of a mixed bag here. How's Cape James looking on your end, Bryan?
Ebony: Hey Trevon, no counterpoints here, u make some solid points. Cape James sounds promising with the tourist draw and low maintenance. Let me add to Cape James:

- Parking: N
- Tourist pop: Y
- Direct competitors: Y
- Foot traffic: Y
- Purchasing cost: Y

Seems like a strong contender. Bryan, Maurice, thoughts on Cape James vs the others?
undefined (bryan): For east point mall, I have Y for parking, N for direct compt, Y for foot traffic, N for tourist, Y for student, Y for quick access, Y for for Large pop of empoyablle
Ebony: Maurice here, chiming in late, sorry! Been digesting your points. Cape James really stands out with its tourism draw and low buying cost, but parking issues could be a pain. Dive deeper on East Point and Starlight dimensions? They might swing votes. Ebony, Trevon, how we leveling these out?
Ebony: Looks like we've got a good Pros and Cons for each location. Quick thought: Cape James has tourist appeal and less competition. East Point's got foot traffic & student presence. Starlight’s big and touristy but lacks workers/students. Starting to feel like Cape James might have an edge given priority on tourism and cost? What’s everyone’s take? Maurice, Trevon, Bryan?
