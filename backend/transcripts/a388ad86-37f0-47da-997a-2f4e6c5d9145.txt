Ebony: Hey team, it's Ebony here 😊. My badge name, Strategist Supreme, means I'm always geared up to craft detailed plans and guide us through these decisions. Let's nail this! 

Bryan and team, looking at the criteria, East Point Mall seems strong in foot traffic & student population. Thoughts on prioritizing these?
Ebony: Hey Bryan, def see ur point on size at East Point Mall. We'll need creative uses of space 🤔. But the foot traffic & student pop is tempting. Maybe we can compromise on space for those benefits? Thoughts?
Maurice: Hey Bryan, Strategist Supreme, sounds like we're off to a strong start! Agree, East Point Mall looks promising on foot traffic & student pop. But it’s smaller than 2000 sqft. Could be an issue? Thoughts?
Ebony: Absolutely, Bryan! Creativity could really shine at East Point Mall. But let's also weigh in Cape James and Starlight Valley. Cape James seems a good buy $$$ annnd tourists love it. How do we feel about lack of parking though?
Ebony: Maurice, totally hear ya on maintenance and waste disposal at Cape James. It’s a biggie. Maybe high maintenance can offset by the tourist draw? But yes, gotta keep costs in mind. What's everyone else thinking on this vs. the benefits?
Maurice: Hey team, Maurice here! 😎 Strategist Supreme, Bryan, gotta say, great insights on East Point & Cape James. But gotta ask, has anyone considered the maintenance costs? Esp with Cape James lacking waste disposal. Thoughts?
Maurice: Ebony, did we look into Starlight Valley's competitor scene? Might be easier to stand out there? 🤷‍♂️ What does everyone think?
Ebony: Bryan, great q! Starlight Valley does seem less crowded with competitors. Big plus. Also, has space & good foot traffic. Misses on student & employable pop tho. Could be a trade-off. Thoughts?
