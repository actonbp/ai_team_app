Trevon: Hey team, Trevon here. Crunch the numbers, expect blunt talk. Let's tally yes's & no's for each spot, rank em. Cape James Beach looks solid btw. High foot traffic, low costs, tourists—big wins. Thoughts? Ebony, Maurice, got input? What’s Bryan's take?
Trevon: East Point is not bad either. 5Y 2N. But maintenance $$$ could be a headache. Less tourists too. We need those tourists $, no? Bryan, views?
Maurice: Totally get ya, Trevon! East Point's got its perks with the 5Y's, esp for foot traffic & job pool. But, no big on tourists, might miss out on that $$. Cape's tourist draw is tempting. Bryan, what's your vibe on this? Prioritizing tourists or local foot traffic?
Ebony: Hey, this is Ebony! To nudge the convo along, looks like each location has its pros & cons. Starlight has a great size, traffic, & tourists but lacks in student pop. & workforce. Cape misses on parking but hits almost all else. Thoughts on how these fit our priorities? Can't ignore parking & workforce size. Bryan, leaning towards any spot yet?
Maurice: Hey Bryan, Ebony, Trevon, Maurice here! Quick take - East point nails foot trffc & workforce but slips on size & tourists. Beach has tourists & compettn edge, struggles wth parking & waste. Starlight, balanced but missing some keys. Weighing all, where's everyone's head at? Priorities?
