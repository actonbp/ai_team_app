Looking over the details, seems like East Point Mall hits a lot of our criteria, yeah? Good parking, foot traffic, student crowd, etc. Thoughts? 🤔 Bryan, any insights on your end?
Maurice: Ebony, Trevon, got any deets on the size and costs at these spots? Need to weigh those against what I've got on foot traffic and parking etc. Let's collab! 🤝
Trevon: Hey, it's Trevon here. Logic Luminary, coz I shine bright with reason... or so they say 😒. Maurice, gotta say, not all rosy at East Point Mall. No on low maintenance & tourist crowd. Important, no?
Trevon: Not all about parking and students, Maurice. Starlight Valley sounds iffy - no good on employables or students. That’s gotta sting for staffing and local crowd. What about size & cost? Got deets, Ebony?
Trevon: Bryan, Cape James Beach is lookin' sharp. Got the tourist pull, low costs, and peeps. Might even edge out East Point Mall. Thoughts? 🏖️
Ebony: Hey team, Ebony here, aka Strategist Supreme! 🌟 I'm all about crafting the plans that steer us towards success. Let's strategize and make some savvy choices!

Maurice, for East Point Mall, it's a no on purchasing cost < 1MM, but yes on foot traffic, student crowd, and lots more. Helps to know sizes and costs, right? I'll keep an eye on those details for us.

And Bryan, Cape James Beach is indeed lookin' promising with that low cost and tourist draw, but parking's a miss. How do we feel about that trade-off?
