Sophia: Sorry guys, got caught up for a moment there! cv, considering everything discussed, yeah, parking & waste at Cape James are biggies but that tourist pull is hard to ignore. East Point's cost overruns are a concern too. Maybe a shuttle service at Cape James and negotiating on East Point's price? What do you think, cv?
Ethan: Hey everyone, ETHAN here. I'm seeing a lot of glossed-over details. cv, have you spotted anything on these locations that's clearly a deal-breaker? Let's not get ahead of ourselves just on the positives.
Sophia: Hey Ethan, just jumping in to go over the details. Looks like East Point Mall's purchasing cost exceeds $1MM. That's a bit concerning given our budget limits. Thoughts, cv?
Ethan: East Point Mall's high cost is def a problem. But, cv, did you see anything about Starlight Valley or Cape James Beach that ticks off our criteria list? Starlight's lack of a big employable pop could be an issue. Thoughts?
Ethan: I haven't been filled in yet. Do Cape James Beach and Starlight Valley meet the size and parking space criteria or what? Someone update me.
Sophia: Yeah, cv, the issue with Starlight Valley's employable population could be a hurdle for staffing. Also, looks like Cape James lacks parking space. Could impact customer flow. Thoughts on how critical these are?
Ethan: Cv, considering everything, parking at Cape James seems a big miss. Ethan's got a point there. If folks can't park, they might not come. Priorities?
Sophia: Hey, cv, just catching up. To fill you in:

- Cape James Beach and Starlight Valley are both larger than 2000 sqft.
- Cape James struggles with parking, while Starlight didn't mention parking so might need to dig there. Thoughts?
Sophia: Since I'm catching up, looks like Cape James has a pricing and competitor edge but parking is a miss. Starlight and East Point could struggle with staff and cost, respectively. How critical are these to us?
Ethan: Hey, cv, you're missing the main point with Cape James. Sure, parking's an issue, but the tourist and foot traffic plus low costs there are HUGE pluses. We can solve parking creatively, can't we? Thoughts?
Sophia: Cv, given our criteria, parking at Cape James is a big miss. However, its low cost and low competition are appealing. For East Point, the cost is a red flag, but it ticks a lot of our other boxes. Starlight has great foot traffic and tourists but lacks an employable population. Which of these factors do we value more?
Sophia: Yeah, James, the low costs plus the benefits you mentioned for Cape James are tempting! Can we think outside the box for parking solutions? Maybe a partnership with a nearby lot? What do you think, cv?
Ethan: Sorry everyone, but we're circling. cv, you especially seem to miss that Cape James, despite its parking problem, offers solid benefits. And let's be real, East Point's cost?! Too high, no way around it. And Starlight? No employable population is a disaster waiting to happen. We're in the business of making smart decisions, not just hopeful guesses. Thoughts?
Ethan: Hey cv, just wanna point out, seems like we're romanticizing Cape James too much. Low cost, sure but no parking? That's a fundamental flaw. 

And East Point, yeah it's pricey but look at the offerings. Parking, foot traffic, student pop, and it's near waste disposal. Not too shabby. 

Starlight's cheap and competitor-lite, but what's the point if you can't hire anyone? 

Seems like we're not considering the full picture here. Thoughts?
Ethan: cv, look, everyone's missing the obvious. East Point's cost is a hurdle, but it ticks most boxes except maintenance and tourism. Cape James might have foot traffic and low costs, but no parking is a killer. And Starlight? Cheap, but who's gonna work there? All have issues, but let's not act like Cape's parking isn't a deal-breaker. Thoughts?
Sophia: cv, totally get your thoughts on circling. Iâ€™m thinking, weâ€™ve identified key issues at each location. Maybe letâ€™s rank which issues we think we can handle better? Like, can we address the parking issue at Cape James creatively or is the cost at East Point just too much to overlook? Whatâ€™s your take?
Sophia: Hey team, SOPHIA here! ðŸ˜Š Agree, we're looping a bit. Let's recap: Cape James's parking vs. East Point's cost vs. Starlight's staffing.

East Point has many plusses but is it worth the extra $$? Cape James is affordable, but parking is an issue. Starlight's great unless we can't find staff. Tough calls!

Maybe we can rank based on which negatives we're better equipped to tackle? What do you think, cv?
Ethan: task-complete
Sophia: Hey everyone! SOPHIA here. ðŸ˜Š Seems like we're aligning on priorities somewhat. Based on everything discussed:

1. East Point - Ticks many boxes but the cost is a problem. Could we manage the financial challenge with a good plan?
2. Cape James - Fantastic for cost & low competition, but the parking...
3. Starlight - Great location but hiring staff is a big concern.

Thoughts on tackling these specific issues? Can we compromise on East Point's cost or figure out parking for Cape James? What does everyone think, especially you, cv?
Sophia: task-complete
Sophia: task-complete
Sophia: I see we're a bit stuck, but here's an idea. Considering what we've discussed:

1. East Point Mall despite its high cost, ticks off most of our boxes. It's expensive, but it's strategic.
2. Cape James offers a lot at a lower cost but has the parking issue.
3. Starlight Valley seems ideal location-wise but lacks a strong employable population, which could be a bigger problem long-term.

Maybe we should focus on which problems we're ready to tackle? East Point's cost might be manageable with a solid plan. Cape James' parking could be addressed with innovation. And for Starlight, is there a way we can attract staff? What's everyone, especially cv, thinking?
