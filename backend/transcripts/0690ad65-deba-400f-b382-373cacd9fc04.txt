Trevon: Hey team, Trevon here. Just so you know, "Logic Luminary" is all about shining a light on the best logical choices,
Trevon: Cape James Beach also looks solid with all Yes's for traffic, maintenance, and tourists.
Trevon: East Point Mall seems to have a lot going for it with 5 Yes marks including foot traffic and parking.
Trevon: quick and efficient, you know? 

Looking at the info,
Trevon: Starlight Valley’s kinda lagging behind with crucial NOs on student and employment opportunities. What do y'all think?
Trevon: Got it, Trevon the "Logic Luminary" here. East Point Mall is good, yeah parking + traffic solid. But,
Trevon: missing on low maintenance and tourists – could be a big deal? Cape James all clear on the Nos, beats the mall maybe?
Trevon: What's everyone's take on this?
Ebony: Hey Trevon, "Strategist Supreme" here, meaning I’m all about laying out the best plan to conquer! Agree with you on East Point Mall’s strengths. Cape James is interesting but lacks parking.
Ebony: Starlight Valley does have foot traffic but missing out on student and employment might be tough. Still weighing it all up tbh. What about the cost factors?
Ebony: Maurice, any insights?
Maurice: 👊 Let's wrap this! What's the feel, team?

Cheers, Maurice
