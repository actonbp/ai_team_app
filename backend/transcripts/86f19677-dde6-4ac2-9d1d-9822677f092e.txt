Ebony: Hey team, Ebony here! My badge name, Strategist Supreme, reflects my knack for crafting detailed plans and bringing folks together on a strategy. Letâ€™s dive into ranking these locations! Given the info, I'm thinking we start by comparing basic needs and standout features. Thoughts? Bryan, how do you feel about the parking situation's importance at these places?
Ebony: Hey Bryan, thanks for jumping right in! Parking is a biggie, especially if customers struggle to find spots. Looks like East Point Mall and Starlight Valley tick the box, but Cape James Beach doesn't. That's a bummer for the beach spot, right?
