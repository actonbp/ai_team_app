Ebony: Hey team, Ebony here! I see cool guy just joined the chat. Welcome to the team! Should we all first introduce ourselves and explain our badge name like the task directions said?
Sophia: Hey team, I'm Sophia (Strategist Supreme here ðŸ˜Ž)! Tackling these locations, I've noticed some key details:

East Point Mall is kinda mixed with 5 Yeses but it lacks on tourist attraction and it's over our budget. Starlight Valley seems promising for tourists and has good space, but might be short on staffing and student vibes. Cape James Beach covers most bases except for parking. What do you all think?
James: Hey Sophia! East Point Mall does look decent with the high job pool and foot traffic. Itâ€™s missing that tourist draw, though. Starlight Valley could use more peeps for hiring, huh? Cape James has that tourist pull but parking sounds like a hassle. Tough calls! ðŸ¤” Whatâ€™s everyone leaning towards?
Sophia: Exactly, Bryan, parking at Cape James is a bit of an issue but it ticks most other boxes. Starlight Valley has great features but the lack of employable people could be a prob. Maybe the tourist attraction can offset that? Still, East Pointâ€™s got a lot of practical pros despite missing the tourists. Thoughts, James or Ethan? How are you ranking these?
