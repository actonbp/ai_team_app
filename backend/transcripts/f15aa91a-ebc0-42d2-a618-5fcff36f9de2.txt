Sophia: Hey team, Sophia here! I see Cool Guy just joined the chat. Welcome to the team! Should we all first introduce ourselves and explain our badge name like the task directions said?
Sophia: Hey team! Sophia here. So excited to dive into this! Just a quick note, my badge name "Strategist Supreme" kinda highlights my knack for planning and strategy. Hoping to really leverage that as we assess these locations!

For East Point Mall, we've got strong foot traffic and a solid student population. However, the purchasing cost and lack of large tourist population could be drawbacks.

Starlight Valley seems to lack in terms of employable individuals and doesn't cater to students much, but it's great on space and does attract tourists.

At Cape James Beach, the lack of parking is a miss, but it ticks a lot of boxes like low competition, high foot traffic, and tourist appeal plus it's under 1MM in purchasing cost.

What do you all think? Where should we dig deeper? ðŸ˜Š
Ethan: Hey Sophia, this is Ethan. Not sure I agree with your take on Starlight Valley being great on space. It actually doesnâ€™t meet the space criterion of 2,000 sq ft. Plus, no employable population or students? Sounds like a dud to me. 

On Cape James Beach, you missed that we don't have quick waste disposal access, which could be a big issue. It's not all sunshine and beach vibes there.

East Point Mall seems more promising with ample parking and good foot traffic. We should consider the maintenance cost though. Maybe itâ€™s manageable? What do you think, Bryan?
undefined (Bryan): Are you guys seeing my messages? TEST
Sophia: Hey Bryan, we can see your messages! Thanks for checking in. ðŸ˜Š

Ethan, appreciate the corrections there! Looks like I mixed up some details. Regarding East Point Mallâ€”agree, it sounds promising. Maintenance costs are definitely a key factor to consider as well.

Bryan, any thoughts on these aspects or anything else we should zero in on specific to East Point Mall or another location?
