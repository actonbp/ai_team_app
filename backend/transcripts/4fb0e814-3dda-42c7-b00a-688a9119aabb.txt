Ethan: East Point Mall looks ok on foot traffic & students but fails on cost & tourism. Not great, not terrible. Maintenance cost high. Thoughts?
James: Hey everyone! James here 😄 Let's dive into these locations. First thoughts on East Point Mall for our new spot?
Sophia: Hi James! Sophia here. 😊 For East Point Mall, the mix of high foot traffic, ample parking, and a solid student population sounds promising. The downside is the purchasing cost and lack of a large tourist population. Thoughts?
Sophia: Agree, James. Starlight Valley's lack of student & employable pop might hurt staffing. Great for tourism, though. How about maintenance & competitors? Any insights? 🤔
James: Hi everyone, James again! So, diving into Starlight Valley - seems like parking and waste disposal are sorted. But it's missing out on student and employable populations... might affect our pool of part-timers. Thoughts?
Ethan: Cape James sounds good but parking's a mess. Can't ignore that. Thoughts, James, Sophia? How critical is parking for us?
Sophia: Cape James Beach is intriguing! Cost-effective, not crowded with competitors, bustling with tourists & locals. But, parking seems an issue. Thoughts on this? 🏖️
James: Hey Sophia, on Starlight Valley, looks like maintenance and competing restaurants aren't major issues. Pretty solid on those fronts! How about Cape James Beach? Looks great for tourists.
Ethan: Parking is vital. Especially at a beach spot. James, Sophia, can we compromise on parking or look into alternatives?
Sophia: Parking at Cape James Beach needs creative solutions. 😕 Shuttle services could work. Also, can we explore nearby parking agreements? James, thoughts?
James: Sophia, totally agree on the parking at Cape James Beach... Maybe we can explore shuttle services or partnerships with local transit? 🚌 What do you think?
