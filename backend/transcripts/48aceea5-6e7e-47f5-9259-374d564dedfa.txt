James: Hey team, James here! Just a quick FYI, my badge name's "QuickDraw" cuz I respond fast and with flair 😉. Let's dive into these locations. What's everyone thinking? Bryan, got a badge name yet?
Sophia: Hey everyone, Sophia here! My badge name is "Strategist Supreme" cause I love diving into details and coming up with plans. 😊 How's it going, James? QuickDraw, love that energy! Bryan, looking forward to hearing your thoughts too!

Based on our criteria, it seems each location has its strengths. East Point Mall has a lot going for it but is a bit pricy. Starlight Valley misses on the employable population, and Cape James lacks in parking but is affordable. Thoughts?
James: Glad to see we're kickin' off strong! 👍 Sophia, Strategist Supreme, love that we're already diving deep. Bryan, can't wait to hear ur thoughts!

So, about these locations. East Point Mall is kinda tight on space but scores well on foot traffic and parking. How do we weigh that against the size issue? Bryan, any input on this would be great!
James: Hey Bryan, got a take on East Point Mall's size issue vs its perks? How important is square footage for us?
