Ethan: Sophia, the size issue at East Point's a red flag for sure. But donâ€™t forget Starlight Valley lacks a solid labor force and student crowd. Could impact biz long term. Thoughts, Bryan?
James: Hey team, James here! Quick thought: let's tackle this by sharing key insights on each location. Remember, looking for most "Y's", fewest "N's". What's everyone got? ðŸš€ #TeamWorkMakesTheDreamWork
James: Got some info on East Point Mall: lots of parking, high foot traffic, yes to students, quick waste disposal & employable folks, but under 2000 sqft. Thoughts? #DetailsMatter
Ethan: Sophia, did u even check the square footage? East Point Mall is under 2k sqft. Not gonna cut it for space. #MissedTheMark
