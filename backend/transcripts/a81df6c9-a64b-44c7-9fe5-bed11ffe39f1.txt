Ebony: Hey Maurice! Agree, East Point Mall's size might be a challenge. We'd probably have to get creative with the layout. What's everyone else thinking? 🤷‍♀️ Bryan, insights?
Maurice: Hey team, it's Maurice here! Quick question: Bryan, what's your take on East Point Mall's space? Under 2000 sqft seems tight. Thoughts? 🤔
Ebony: Hey team, Ebony here! Just a heads up, my badge name "Strategist Supreme" means I'm all about diving deep into plans and making sure we're set for success 😊. Regarding East Point Mall, yeah, the space is a concern. Maybe we can make it work if it's a high-traffic area? Plus, with the student pop, could be a good lunch spot. What do y’all think? Maurice, Bryan, thoughts?
