Ebony: Hey team, Ebony here. Quick heads up, my badge name's all about offering detailed plans - I'll try to keep things succinct though. Let's start evaluating these locations on our criteria. Based on my info, East Point Mall seems strong in terms of foot traffic, student population, and accessible waste disposal. Thoughts?
Ebony: Maurice, Trevon, how's it lookin on ur end? Does Starlight Valley or Cape James Beach look promisin with the criteria we got?
Trevon: Trevon here, I'm the numbers guy, don't expect fluff from me. Starlight Valley? Looks meh, misses on student and employable pop. Cape James, tourist haven though. East Point ain't perfect, high maintenance, no tourists. Ebony, your take on tourists & students at Cape James?
