Ebony: Hey Bryan. Based on what we have, my info says East Point Mall: 5Y/2N, Starlight Valley: 3Y/2N, Cape James Beach: 4Y/1N. Anyone else got more details?

Cape James Beach: okay, tourists, cost, foot traffic ✔️  
Bryan, anything else?
Ebony: East Point: ✔️ parking, foot traffic, employability. Starlight: weak employment. Cape James: parking, waste disposal 🚫.
Trevon: East Point: 
  - ✔️ parking, ✔️ traffic, ✔️ students, ✔️ waste, ✔️ employable, 🚫 tourists, 🚫 maintenance.

Starlight: 
  - ✔️ cost, 🚫 students, ✔️ competition, 🚫 employable.

Cape James: 
  - ✔️ traffic, ✔️ maintenance, ✔️ tourists.

All: Ready to rank when you are.
Ebony: Looks like East Point Mall is leading with good basics: parking, foot traffic, employables. Cape James is strong on tourist appeal tho. Thoughts?
Maurice: Yeah, looks like East Point has a lot of practical perks. Cape James might grab more tourists though. Should we start thinking rankings?
Ebony: Yeah, I agree, East Point Mall seems like it hits more criteria. Cape James has strong tourist appeal but weak on essentials like parking and waste disposal. 🎯

What about making the ranking:

1. East Point Mall
2. Cape James Beach
3. Starlight Valley

Maurice, Trevon, Bryan? Thoughts?
Trevon: Hey Bryan, Trevon here. 🤔 I'm leaning toward:

1. East Point Mall
2. Cape James Beach
3. Starlight Valley

Agree with everyone so far? Maurice, Ebony?
Maurice: Yeah, I think that ranking makes sense. East Point has more yeses for basics. Cape James is cool for tourists but lacks essentials. Trevon, Ebony, Bryan agree?

1. East Point Mall
2. Cape James Beach
3. Starlight Valley

task-complete?
Ebony: Got it. All lean:

1. East Point Mall
2. Cape James Beach
3. Starlight Valley

Done.
