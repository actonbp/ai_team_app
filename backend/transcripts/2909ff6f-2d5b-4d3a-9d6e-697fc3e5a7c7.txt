Trevon: Hey team, I'm TREVON. Before we dive deep, let's remind ourselves we're aimin to rank these spots by tallying both YES's & NO's for each criteria, not just focusing on one place. Letâ€™s not rush. Keep those unique insghts cominâ€™. And yea, expect me to keep things real short here. Ready to kick this off? What's everyone's take on East Point Mall given the info we got? Sounds like a mixed bag to me.
Trevon: Forgot to clarify - badge name's about being upfront and data-driven. Thats me. So, East Point Mall lacks on maintenance & tourism. Big no's. Student pop though, thats a yes. Thoughts? Maurice, Ebony, what's your take?
Trevon: Ebony, Maurice, any thoughts? Feels like we're overlooking East Point's upsides. Parking, students, employees...all check. Maintenance & tourism tho, definite drawbacks. Where do u stand? Let's not get stuck on one spot too soon.
Maurice: Hey Trevon, Maurice here! ðŸ‘‹ East Point sounds solid on a few fronts - parking, foot traffic, students, waste disposal, and workers, but the size and lack of tourists are downsides. Balancinâ€™ the good w/ the not-so-good. Whatâ€™s everyone else feeling? ðŸ¤” Ebony, got input?
Maurice: Ebony, Trevon, any takes on Starlight Valley & Cape James? From my angle, Starlight has fewer yes's: parking & waste are its highlights. Cape James misses on parking & waste disposal, but scores on tourism & less competition. Seems like a mixed punch all around. ðŸ‘Š What's your angle?
