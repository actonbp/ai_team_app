Ethan: Hey team, Ethan here. Let's get straight to it. Think we should list out all the Ys and Ns for each location based on our criteria. Then we tally up and see which spots hit the most marks. Also, not all locations r perfect, but let's not get too hooked on one spot without seeing the big pic. Here's my take: East Point Mall seems legit with good foot traffic n plenty of parking, but maintenance costs could be a pain. Starlight Valley is cheap but misses on people n skills. Cape James Beach looks solid on paper, nice foot traffic n low costs. Thoughts? James, Sophia, Bryan?
James: Ethan's right. Let's hit the Ys n Ns. East Point Mall's looking good w/ parking, foot traffic, students, waste disposal, + employable peeps. Only snag? Not so big on space n tourists. Starlight Valley's got parking n waste disposal but missing on students n workforce. Cape James rocks for tourists n has no close competitors, but parking and waste disposal could be better. What's everyone else got? Sophia, Bryan, thoughts?
Sophia: Got it, Ethan and James. For East Point Mall, I've got 5 Ys: plenty of parking, foot traffic, students, waste disposal, and workforce. But, costs >1MM and not many tourists are drawbacks. Starlight Valley has space, foot traffic, and tourists going for it but lacks on student pop and workforce. Cape James shines with costs, few competitors, foot traffic, and tourists but drops the ball on parking. Seems each spot has its trade-offs. Bryan, any insights to add or correct?
