Ethan: Hey everybody, it's Ethan. FYI, bad internet here, might be slow. 🙄 So, started looking at our choices. East Point Mall looks ok, but seriously? No tourist attraction? Big miss there. Thoughts? Bryan, got an opinion?
Ethan: Ethan: You're kinda missing the point on East Point Mall. Sure, tourists boost, but do we wanna depend on seasonal visitors? Foot traffic & students = consistent business. Maintenance costs though, that's a concern. Bryan, weigh in?
Sophia: Hey Ethan! Yeah, totally see ur point bout East Point Mall missing the tourist vibe. Tourism can really boost a resturant's profile. 🏖️ But its got good foot traffic & a big student crowd. Maybe worth considering for a diff demographic? 🤔 Bryan, thinking the same or got a diff take?
Ethan: Bryan, u think high costs at EPM can just be shrugged off? 🤨 With that over 1MM tag, we're already in the red before we open doors. James, "Master of Motivation" or not, numbers don't lie. What’s ur take, folks?
Sophia: Hey, James and Ethan, good points all arond! 🚀 I'm leaning twrds valuing consistent bizz from students and foot traffic at EPM. It's not just about season. But the purchasing cost over 1MM is a big red flag. 🚩 Bryan, do u think high cost is a dealbreaker or manageable?
James: Hi team! James here, aka Master of Motivation! 🚀 My badge means I'm all about keeping the spirit up and moving us forward. Let's tackle this challenge with some pep! 🎉

Ethan, Sophia, totally get the points on EPM's pros. Missing the tourists tho... big oof. 🏖️ Bryan, thoughts here? How's that weighing in for you?
James: James is typing...
