Ethan: Hey team, I'm Ethan. Known for being blunt and analytical. Let's not waste time, okay? East Point Mall seems weak on maintenance and tourists. Thoughts, Bryan?
Ethan: Oops, ignore my last msg. Already dived in there. So, Bryan, East Point Mall's got its perks but low on maint and tourists. Big deal or not?
Sophia: Hey team, Sophia here! Yeah, planning's my jam, and I'm all about that team vibe. Ethan, totally hear ya on East Point Mall. It's a mixed bag, huh? Good on parking, foot traffic, student pop, and for our staff needs. But yeah, not a tourist hotspot and we gotta think about those upkeep costs. Thoughts?
Sophia: Since we don't know about Cape James Beach's maintenance & employee pool, could make it a gamble. Starlight Valley seems solid on tourist & space size, but might be hard staffing it. How do we feel about these trade-offs? James, got any insights on maintenance costs maybe?
James: Hey folks, James here! ðŸ˜„ Throwinâ€™ in my quick two cents. Call me the "Speedster" coz I like getting to the point fast. On maintenance, Iâ€™ve got nada for you, Bryan. But lemme toss this â€“ East Point Mall's got good foot traffic and a solid employable pool, just lacks on the tourist side. Kinda leans towards good for locals, not tourists. Thoughts?
Sophia: Ethan, thinking more about what you said, East Point might not hit on tourists, but could we consider targeting the local market more? With its student pop and local workforce, might not need as much tourist draw. Plus, waste disposal's a plus. Thoughts, Bryan?
