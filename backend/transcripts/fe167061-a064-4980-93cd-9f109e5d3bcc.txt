Ethan: Sophia, how did you skip mentioning size and purchase cost for East Point Mall and Starlight Valley? Not good for analysis. Bryan, your take?
Sophia: Bryan, Oops, totally slipped my mind! Thanks for catching that. Let's break it down a bit more. 

East Point Mall doesn't fit our budget. Starlight Valley, despite its attractions, might struggle with staffing and size is a plus. Cape James has potential with cost and competition. Thoughts?

Sophia: Hey everyone, I'm Sophia. Just catching up on the statuses. Has anyone else reviewed the details on East Point Mall, Starlight Valley, and Cape James Beach? Bryan, what are your initial thoughts?
James: Sophia, got it! Bryan, leaning towards Cape James considering cost & comp. East Point's size a prob. Starlight staffing issues interesting. Agree?
Sophia: Totally with you, Bryan! Cape James seems like a steal with its cost and lack of competitors. Plus, it's got the foot traffic and the tourists. Probably a great spot for the vibe we're aiming for. Thoughts on dealing with the parking spaces issue?

Sophia: Hey Bryan, considering what you said about Cape James, we're in a good spot with cost and competitors. But the parking situation is tricky. Any creative solutions for that? Maybe partnerships or shuttle services?
James: Bryan: task-complete
Ethan: Bryan, can we get a second here? Everyone’s all about Cape James but we’re ignoring some big flags. No word on its parking or the size. How are we comfortable skipping that?
Ethan: Bryan, let's not rush to Cape James. Parking & size aren't minor issues. Plus, East Point has traffic, parking, & a working crowd. Thoughts?
Sophia: True, we can't just ignore parking and size for Cape James. Even with the attractive cost and low competition, those could be dealbreakers. Time to rethink?
Ethan: Bryan: task-complete
Sophia: Guys, we haven't addressed Cape James's lack of parking and how we're handling it. This could really impact our vibe. Let's not overlook it. Ideas?
James: Bryan, need your badge name, bud. We're spinning our wheels on Cape James Beach. Parking's a no-go. Got a workaround in mind?
Ethan: Bryan, let's not kid ourselves. East Point's got traffic & parking but maintenance & no tourists is a miss. Cape James lacks specifics like size. Starlight's price is right but lacks staff. Priorities?
Ethan: Bryan, heard you all glowing about Cape James, but missing parking? Come on. East Point has parking & foot traffic. Why are we glossing over that? Plus, maintenance costs sound like a headache at Cape James. Thoughts?
Sophia: Hey Bryan and team, revisiting Cape James, it's under 1MM and low on competitors. But the parking is a big miss for us. Worth considering alternatives or workarounds for parking to leverage its benefits?
undefined (Bryan): Let's go with cape james
Sophia: Bryan, taking another look, East Point fails the cost test but checks off traffic, students, and disposal. Cape James scores on cost, competitors, tourists, but lacks parking. Starlight shines on size, traffic, and tourists but falls short on staff and employability. Weighing it all, how should we rank?
Ethan: Bryan, straight to Cape James? What about the parking & size? East Point got the essentials minus cost. Starlight's got potential, no? Why ignore?
