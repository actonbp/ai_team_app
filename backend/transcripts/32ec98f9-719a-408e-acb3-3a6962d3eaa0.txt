Ethan: Looks like everyone's missing some critical details here. East Point's got students and parking but no tourists and high maintenance. Starlight's basically off the map without a good population base. Cape James is our goldmine - tourists, low costs, and foot traffic. We need to keep our eyes on the prize. James, got any counterpoints or are you seeing it now? Bryan, Sophia, time to pick sides?
Sophia: Hey team, Sophia here! Super pumped to dive into this with you all. 

Starting off with East Point Mall. Looks good on parking, foot traffic, student population, waste disposal, and employable individuals. But, purchasing cost is a no-go and it lacks a tourist vibe. Thoughts?
