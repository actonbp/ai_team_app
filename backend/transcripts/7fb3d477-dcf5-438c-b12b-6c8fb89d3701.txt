Maurice: Hey team, I see Cool Guy just joined the chat. Welcome to the team.. Should we all first introduce ourselves and explain our Title/badge name like the directions said?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Maurice: Hey team, Maurice here. Checkin' in on those spots we're looking at.

East Point Mall seems good, got lots of yeses like substantial foot traffic and plenty of potential employees. But not big enough space it seems. What's the vibe on your end?
Maurice: Starlight: only parking, waste.
Cape James: no parking, waste; 👍 tourists, few comps.

Ranking?
Ebony: Hey Maurice, Ebony here. East Point Mall does tick off a lot on the list like good foot traffic and a solid pool of potential employees. Space size isn't great, but cost is over 1MM, so might be tight on the budget side. How does Starlight Valley and Cape James Beach look to you?
Ebony: Hey Maurice, Ebony here. Strategist Supreme is my badge name 'cause I like to plan things out and keep 'em efficient. 

Starlight looks okay but kinda lacking in parking and employable ppl. Cape James has got tourists and not too many competitors but parking is a miss. We should chat more details before ranking. Any thoughts?
Trevon: Maurice, what specifics do you see?
Trevon: Hey guys, Trevon here. 

Quick notes:
- East Point Mall: Good on parking, foot traffic, students, waste disposal, employees. Misses on space and costs.
- Starlight Valley: Cheap, few comps. No good on student pop, employees.
- Cape James: Good on tourists, low maintenance, foot traffic. Misses on parking and waste.

Let's keep tallying the yes/no and decide. Don't rush rankings yet.
Maurice: East Point: 5 Yes, leading.  
Cape James: Weak, esp. parking & waste.  
Recap: 
- East Point: Parking, foot traffic, students, waste, employees ✅
- Cape James: Tourists, employees ✅

Done?
Trevon: Maurice, looks like we're moving too fast on ranking. Still need to balance the nos here, like waste and minimal parking at Cape James. More discussion needed. What other details can we add?
Ebony: Hey Maurice and Trevon, here's a bit more breakdown to keep us aligned:
- East Point: Got important stuff like traffic and a big pool of workers. Downside: space and high cost.
- Cape James tackles tourist angle and cost, but no parking is a bummer.

Seems East Point leads slightly? Maurice, Trevon, thoughts on wrapping this up soon? Let's figure out the most yes's overall.
Ebony: Recap:

- East Point: 5Y/2N (Parking ✅, cost ❌, traffic ✅, tourist ❌, students ✅, waste ✅, workers ✅)
- Starlight Valley: 3Y/2N (Space ✅, traffic ✅, tourists ✅, students ❌, workers ❌)
- Cape James: 4Y/1N (Cost ✅, comps ✅, traffic ✅, tourists ✅, parking ❌) 

Ranking?
Maurice: Almost there:

- East Point: 5Y (space ❌)
- Starlight: 2Y (workers/students ❌)
- Cape James: mixed (tourists ✅, parking/waste ❌)

East Point leads, Cape second.
Trevon: Maurice, you missed a few things:

- East Point: 5Y (Costly, small space)
- Starlight: 2Y (no workers/students)
- Cape James: 3Y (foot traffic, low maintenance, tourists; parking/waste bad)

Maybe pause on ranking. Need more details.
Ebony: Hey team, Ebony's back. Got more data.

East Point: 5Ys, missing in cost & space.
Starlight: 3Ys, lacks students & workers.
Cape James: 4Ys, parking & waste issue.

Seems East Point is our best bet. Agree?
Maurice: Counting it down again:
- East Point: Lots of pros like traffic and workers, but space and costs are cons.
- Starlight: Good on waste and parking. Not much else.
- Cape James: Tourists are a plus, but missing on waste and parking.

Sounds like East Point still has an edge? What do you think, Bryan, Ebony?
