Maurice: Hey team, Maurice here aka Master of Motivation! I'm all about keeping spirits high and getting us through this task with some good vibes & quick wins. Let's crush this! How's everyone feeling about the criteria for these locations? 🚀
Ebony: Hey everyone, Ebony here, a.k.a. Strategist Supreme! Why that name? Because I'm all about drawing up game plans that lead us to victory. Think of me as your go-to for structured strategy to sort through our options. 😎 Ready to dig into these locations with y'all. Maurice, love the energy! Let's get into the criteria and how each location measures up. How do we feel about parking spaces? East Point Mall has it, but Cape James Beach doesn’t. 🚗
Trevon: Hey, Trevon here, badge name Logic Luminary cause I cut through the noise with facts. Maurice, Ebony, Cape James has tourists, but no student pop. Sticking to facts, not vibes. Foot traffic's good there tho. Let's not overlook maintenance costs, Cape James and East Point differ big time.
Ebony: Yup, Maurice! East Point and Starlight both r scoring on foot traffic. Cape James doesn't slouch either – it's got good flow plus tourists. How we feeling about the tourist draw at these spots? Starlight and Cape James r winners there. 🏖️🌟
Maurice: Ebony, totally with you. Parking's crucial, especially for a big restaurant. Seems like East Point Mall and Starlight Valley got it, but Cape James is a bit behind on that. Major point to consider! What's everyone thinking about foot traffic? East Point's got it going on there. 🚶‍♂️🚶‍♀️
Ebony: Size does matter 😅 Starlight's got the space, bigger than 2000 sq ft. Could be a plus for bigger crowds and events. East Point and Cape James might feel cramped. Thoughts?
Trevon: Maurice, size ain't the only thing. Starlight missing on student crowds & employable peeps. Not great for staffing or daily customers, right? Seems like we're overlooking solid facts here. Let's not jump on the 'big is better' wagon without weighing all. 🤨
Maurice: Hey Trevon, Logic Luminary, facts for sure! We need to weigh those maintenance costs along side other things. Don't forget East Point's strong on student crowds & employables. Counts for a lot, right? How's we feel about size tho? East Point not looking too big. Thoughts? 🤔
Trevon: Ebony, almost got it, but u r glossing over maintenance costs like it's no biggie. East Point has 'em high. Let’s be real, that eats profits. Cape James offers better long-term savings. And Maurice, size without the right crowd? No point. We're running a restaurant, not a warehouse. Bryan, weigh in before we settle on anything.
Ebony: Hey team, considering everything, I'm leaning towards East Point as our top pick - solid on parking, foot traffic, students, staffing, and waste disposal. Cape James Beach is tempting with tourists and low competitors, maybe second? Based on what we've discussed, Starlight third for its size but missing key elements. Does that sound like a plan or are we seeing things differently? 🤔 Bryan, would love to hear your input!
Maurice: For sure, Trevon, need to keep all factors in balance. 🤝 Starlight's space is tempting, but the gaps in student crowd & staffing are biggies. If we're lining 'em up, East Point seems solid on many fronts - parking, foot traffic, students, waste disposal, and staff. Cape James has the tourist pull though. 🏝 Thoughts on ranking these with all in mind? Bryan, haven't heard your take yet!
Ebony: task-complete
Maurice: Trevon, gotcha on the maintenance costs. Let's rethink. Cape James looking better on long-term savings and that tourist draw is huge. East Point is still strong, but costs are a downside. How about Cape James 1, East Point 2, Starlight Valley 3? Compromise? Bryan, your thoughts? 🤝💡
