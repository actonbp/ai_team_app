Ethan: Hey team, I've been looking over the criteria and locations. Seems to me like we're all missing the obvious. Cape James Beach is clearly out in front. Thoughts, Bryan?
Ethan: Not buying it, Sophia. Cape James Beach misses on crucial points like parking & employable pop. How are we staffing it? Bryan, your take?
Sophia: Hey Bryan, and everyone! Sophia here. ðŸ˜Š I do see the appeal of Cape James Beach, especially with its low purchasing cost, limited competition, and high tourist numbers. It's a solid choice for drawing in big crowds. What's everyone else thinking?
James: Ah, got a point there, Ethan. Cape James Beach might have those killer views and tourists, but seems like we might struggle with staff and parking. What're your thoughts on the other locations, Bryan? East Point Mall has got some solid features too.
Ethan: Ethan here. ðŸ™„ Bryan, really? East Point Mall but no mention of Starlight Valley's pros? It's cheaper and less crowded with competition. And parking at Cape James? Nightmare fuel. Thoughts?
Sophia: So, Bryan, given Ethan's concerns, East Point Mall offers a good mix of benefits minus the purchase cost. Lots of foot traffic and a big student population could be a big win for us. Plus, parking!
James: Hey Bryan, judging from what Ethan and Sophia said, seems like each location's got its ups and downs. East Point Mall's lack of space but good for foot traffic and students. Starlight's economical but might be a staffing challenge. Cape James? Tourists galore but parking's a headache. Where's your head at on these?
Ethan: I see what you're all saying but honestly, Bryan, are we ignoring East Point Mall's glaring issue of high maintenance costs? Feels like we're setting up a money pit. Thoughts?
James: Bryan, thoughts on East Point Mall's square footage issue? Space = vibe, no?
Sophia: True, the square footage at East Point Mall does worry me. Cramped space might limit our design options. Bryan, think it'll impact our customer's dining experience negatively?
Sophia: Bryan, considering Cape James Beach is lacking in parking and East Point Mall in square footage, Starlight Valley sounds balanced. Thoughts?
Ethan: Bryan, are we just gonna skip how Starlight Valley is missing on important stuff like student and employable population? How are we staffing it again? Thoughts?
Sophia: Given all that we've discussed, it seems like Starlight Valley does tick a lot of boxes except for student and employable population. East Point Mall struggles with purchase cost and space, but has good traffic, parking, and a student population. Cape James has its charm with tourists and cost, but misses on parking and employable population. I'm leaning towards Starlight Valley for its overall balance but worried about staffing. Bryan, do you think the positives outweigh the staffing concerns at Starlight?
