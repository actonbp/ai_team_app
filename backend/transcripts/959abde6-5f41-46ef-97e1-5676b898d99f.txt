Maurice: Hey team, Maurice here- I see we are all here. Welcome.. Maybe we should all introduce ourselves and then jump into the task?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Maurice: Hey folks! So, looking at East Point Mall, it's got good marks on parking, foot traffic, students,
Maurice: waste disposal, and employability but lacks on size and tourists.
Maurice: Thoughts? Trevon, Bryan, what's your take?...
Maurice: Yeah, East Point Mall seems decent on some points, but missing the tourist crowd might be a hit. What about Cape James Beach? Big on tourists, but parking's a miss there.
Ebony: Hi all, Ebony here! Agree with the points on East Point Mall.
Ebony: What do u guys think, Maurice, Bryan?...
Ebony: What about Cape James Beach? Seems it lacks parking but scores well on cost, competitors, foot traffic, and tourists. Might be a strong contender too.
Trevon: Hey Bryan and Ebony, good points on both locations. From my side, Cape James Beach looks strong with zero nosâ€”solid on foot traffic, maintenance costs, and tourists. Could make up for lacking a bit on parking. What about Starlight Valley? Got any thoughts on that?
Trevon: Hey Maurice, just to chip in - Starlight Valley's kinda mixed.
Trevon: Not sure it's strong enough compared to the others.
Trevon: It hits good on cost and lack of competitors but drops on student and employee availability.
