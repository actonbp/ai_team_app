Ethan: Hey team, I see COOL GUY just joined the chat. Welcome to the team.. Should we all first introduce ourselves and explain our Title/badge name like the directions said?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Ethan: Hey, Ethan here. Just to clarify, they call me a Logic Luminary cause I'm all about facts and reasoning, nothing too fancy, just straight to the point. So, looking at our criteria, East Point Mall does really well with 5 Yes out of the crucial criteria, but two big No's. Starlight Valley, sort of weak, only got 2 Yes. Cape James Beach seems perfect with no No so far. Thoughts?
Sophia: Hey Ethan, Sophia here. Got the title Strategist Supreme, which basically means I try to keep the big picture in mind when making plans. About the locations, seems like East Point Mall has some good perks especially with foot traffic and employable population but that lack of tourist vibe and higher purchasing cost could be a setback.
Sophia: Starlight Valley doesn't look too strong on several fronts like employee availability. Cape James is missing on parking but scores well overall. What you think, James?
