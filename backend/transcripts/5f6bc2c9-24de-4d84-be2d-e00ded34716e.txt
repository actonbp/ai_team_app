Ethan: East Pnt looses points on maintence and tourism. Not ideal. Thoughts, Bryan, James?
Sophia: Hey team, Sophia here! Just checking in, have we looked into how each location fares on maintenance costs and competition nearby? We shouldn't overlook those. ðŸ˜Š
James: Got it, Sophia! East Point's downsides noted. Bryan, any insights on Starlight Valley or Cape James for maintenance and competition?
Ethan: Sounds like Cape James is our winner here. Easy upkeep, tourists everywhere. Starlight's issues seem big, no workers or students? Come on. Bryan, thoughts?
Sophia: Based on what Bryan mentioned, it seems like Starlight Valley is strong in tourism and foot traffic but might fall short on the employable population and size criteria. Cape James seems promising with the cost, competitors, tourism, and foot traffic. Thoughts?
James: East Point's tight on space tho, not good for us. Parking at Cape James, waste disposal hitch? Ugh. Bryan, how we feeling on these?
Sophia: Bryan, given all this, it's tricky. East Point has space + waste issues but hits on foot traffic and employables. Parking and cost issues for Cape James, but ticks major boxes elsewhere. Seems like a balance game. Preferences?
James: James is typing...
