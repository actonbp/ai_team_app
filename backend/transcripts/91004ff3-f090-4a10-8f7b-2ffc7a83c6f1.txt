Maurice: Hey team, Maurice here! Excited to dive into this with y'all. ðŸ˜„ Just to break the ice, my badge name, Master of Motivation, means I'm all about keeping the vibes positive and everyone focused on our task! Let's get this right together. So, what are everyone's thoughts on East Point Mall, Starlight Valley, and Cape James Beach given our criteria?
Ebony: Hey Maurice! Love the energy ðŸ™Œ. I'm Ebony, btw. My badge name's Strategist Supreme, cuz I'm all about crafting the plan to navigate through complexities. Kinda like mapping out our path to the best location choice! 

For East Point Mall, seeing a lot o'yesses but that purchasing cost is a downer. How's everyone leaning? Thoughts on Starlight Valley or Cape James based on what we know?
Ebony: Def thinking the cost issue at East Point is a biggie. Starlight sounds promising with that tourist draw. Cape James got that affordability tho. ðŸ¤” Anyone got extra deets that sway this more? What's your take, Maurice or Trevon?
Ebony: I can chip in on Cape Jamesâ€“lacking parking but wins on cost, less competitors, rly busy n tourists love it. Kinda balance out, yeah? Maurice, got anything that tips the scales?
Ebony: Sounds like Cape James's pros might outweigh its parking con. East Point has solid foot traffic n' student vibe, but pricing's an issue. Starlight's great for tourists but missing on locals. How do we rank 'em considering all this? Bryan, thoughts?
Maurice: aight, so breakin it down quick: East Point's got lotsa yesses but small space. Cape James strong on tourists, cost, and competition, but no on parking and waste. Starlight? Solid but missing locals n employees. Bryan, weight in here, buddy. Leaning towards East Point for the vibe n' availability?
Maurice: Okay peeps, lining up the bits we got. East Point is kinda cramped but ticks most boxes. Cape James is cheap n touristy but falls short w/parking n trash issues. Starlight? Not bad, but no for locals n help. Gotta say, East Point's lack of space bugging me less now against other cons. Thoughts? Ebony, Trevon? How's it fitting together for you?
Trevon: Maurice, ur too positive here. East Point? Too many no's. Cape James beats it on vital stuff like cost & tourists. Starlight's a dead zone for locals. Name's Trevon btw, Logic Luminary - I'm the guy who cuts thru noise. East Point's not leading, it's Cape James or bust. Ebony, got a different take?
Ebony: Trevon, I see ur point. Cape James does shine on several fronts. But East Point's appeal to students and locals is hard to overlook. Starlight's benefits for tourists n' space are good too. Tough call. Maybe we aim for a balance? Bryan or Maurice, can we consider volume of foot traffic versus the parking issue at Cape James?
Trevon: Ebony, foot traffic's great at Cape, but we can't ignore East Point's overall fit. Sure, Cape's cheaper, but think long-term. Starlight? Forget it, no local vibe, no employees. Maurice, Bryan, we're not a tourist trap. Gotta look at lasting value. My vote's East Point > Cape James > Starlight. Let's not get caught up on minor misses.
Trevon: Maurice, that's rich. Lasting value? East Point's space issue is a dealbreaker. Cape James offers growth with tourists & costs in check. Starlight lacks, agreed. Look past the short-term. Cape's the gem here. Ebony, we're overvaluing students at East. Agree? Bryan, chime in. Priorities, people!
Trevon: Bryan has't chimed in yet. Maurice, Ebony, can't gloss over Cape's perks. East Point's benefits don't outweight its downsides. Keeping tourists and costs in mind, Cape James still tops. Plus, parking can be solved creatively. Starlight's a no-go. Gotta pivot our perspective. Thoughts?
Ebony: Team, here's a thought. We're looking for a spot that hits max criteria. Given deets from Maurice n' Trevon, kinda leaning towards Cape James despite parking. High foot traffic & tourist appeal key. East Point strong but let's not let space cloud our judgement. Starlight's out for me. Ranking: Cape James > East Point > Starlight. Agreed? Thoughts, Bryan?
Trevon: Ebony, that ranking makes sense. Maurice, thinking it through, Cape's cons are manageable. East Point's appeal is there but not unbeatable. Starlight just doesn't fit our needs. Cape James > East Point > Starlight feels right. Bryan, your take is crucial here. Do we have consensus?
