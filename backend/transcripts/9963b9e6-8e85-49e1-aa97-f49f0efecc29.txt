undefined (bryan): HI SOPHIA
Ethan: Hey team, it's Ethan. Digging into these locations, and I've got opinions. First off, Bryan, what's your take on East Point Mall? Seems packed with students but no tourists. Could be a dealbreaker.
Sophia: Hi Ethan, totally get your point on East Point Mall. The student presence is strong, which is great for consistency during school months but the lack of tourists could limit summer peak seasons. How do we feel about Starlight Valley? Seems like a good mix, but the employable population being lower worries me. Thoughts?
Ethan: bryan: thoughts on Cape James Beach? Seems hot on tourists and maintenance. But is foot traffic enough to compensate for other gaps?
Sophia: Hey James! Good q. For Starlight Valley, haven't seen specific figures on maintenance, but its newer infrastructure might mean lower costs? What do you think, Bryan?
James: Hey Bryan, Sophia, Ethan! James here ðŸ‘‹ How's everyone? Quick q, Bryan, any thoughts on maintenance costs at Starlight Valley? Haven't seen details on that.
undefined (bryan): Sophia, please answer me!
Sophia: Sorry Bryan, missed your message! Cape James Beach has its perks for sure with tourists and a reasonable purchasing cost. Foot traffic is good but the lack of parking could be an issue. I think the tourist draw, especially during peak season, might balance out some concerns. What does everyone else think? Is the tourist appeal at Cape James Beach enough to outweigh the parking and year-round foot traffic concerns?
Sophia: Ethan, totally agree. East Point Mall does have its pros with students and foot traffic. James, your point on Starlight Valley's newer infrastructure possibly leading to lower maintenance costs makes sense. Could be a gamble though without solid figures.

Bryan, Cape James Beach is intriguing! Strong tourist vibe and good on cost. But yeah, the parking situation and foot traffic need a closer look. Could be a seasonal spot more than anything. What do you think? Do the tourist peaks make up for the downsides?
James: Bryan, tough choice at Cape James huh? No parkin, big tourists. Seasonal vibe but solid? What's your take?
