Ebony: Hey everyone, Ebony here! ðŸ˜Š I come with a detailed planning badge lol. Ready to dive into the locations details with all of you. Let's start by sharing what we know? I've got some key info on the parking, cost, and demographic aspects for each spot. How about we tackle these one by one?
Ebony: Hey all! Maurice here. Got some insights on space size, maintenance costs, and potential competion for the sites. How we doing on ticking off the criteria list?
Maurice: Sounds like a plan, Ebony! For East Point Mall, we've got good parking, high foot traffic, and a large student pop. But, space is a bit tight, not over 2000 sqft. No big tourist crowd there. What's everyone else got?
