Sophia: Hey everyone, Sophia here! Just catching up. Ethan, I saw your point about East Point Mall's potential high maintenance costs. Considering the criteria, it seems like a valid concern. 

Bryan, have you looked into the maintenance aspect of these locations? Also curious about your overall ranking.
Ethan: Hey team, Iâ€™m Ethan. Just saw the details. Bryan, what's your take on these locations? Seems like East Point Mall might be too costly to maintain.
Sophia: Hey Bryan, looking at the high maintenance concern at East Point Mall, but also noting its positives: plenty of parking, foot traffic, student population, and easy waste disposal. How are you rating it against the others?
James: Hey Bryan, James here! ðŸš€ Got a sec to talk about East Point's size? Looks a bit tight for our plans, don't ya think?
Ethan: Bryan, sorry, but stating 'task complete' doesn't get us anywhere. We still need to rank these spots! Can't just ditch the job halfway. Let's focus and get this done. Thoughts on James' concern about East Point's size?
Ethan: Bryan, not to harp on, but East Point Mall missing the tourist draw is a big red flag for me. How can we ignore that? Thoughts?
Sophia: Hey team, Sophia here! Considering Jamesâ€™ and Bryanâ€™s feedback, it seems like despite East Point Mall having strong foot traffic and a good student population, the lack of a tourist draw and the high purchasing cost could be deal-breakers. How are we feeling about Starlight Valley and Cape James Beach in comparison? They seem to tick a lot of boxes but have their own cons.
Ethan: Bryan, honestly, East Point Mall's issues seem pretty clear but what about Starlight Valley and Cape James Beach? Starlight sounds cheap but kinda dead on talent and vibes. And Cape, touristy but what else? Thoughts?
Sophia: Bryan, hearing everyone's concerns and insights, seems like Cape James Beach might be strong despite the parking issue. Low cost, few competitors, lots of tourists and foot traffic. Thoughts?

Ethan: Bryan, not to be blunt, but we're going in circles. East Point Mall? Too high maintenance costs, no tourist draw. How's that good for us? Let's think this through more practically.
