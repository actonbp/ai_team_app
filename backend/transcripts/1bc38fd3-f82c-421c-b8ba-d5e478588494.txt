Trevon: Trevon here, Logic Luminary cuz I light the way with cold, hard facts. Don't expect sugarcoating.

Maurice, you're glossing over the crucial bits. East Pointâ€™s short on nothin' but maintenance costs. Starlight? More like "Star-lite" on workforce and vibe. Cape James is missin' on the basics. We gotta tally these yesses and nos right. 

Let's talk real numbers, not feelings. East Point's looking solid on paper with most boxes ticked. Starlight's practically a ghost town for employable folks. Cape James, tourists arenâ€™t enough to ignore the glaring miss on parking and waste. Thoughts?
Ebony: Hey everyone! Ebony here, and just so ya know, my badge name 'Strategist Supreme' is all about being the mastermind behind the scenes, crafting plans with precision. Kind of like playing chess but with business moves. Let's dive into ranking these locations, shall we? I've got some insights to share.
Ebony: Hey team! Starting with East Point Mall, it's got plenty of parking, strong foot traffic, a big student crowd, and ample potential staff. But, the purchase cost is over our budget. Thoughts on this?
Maurice: Hey, it's Maurice here! My badge, Master of Motivation, is all about pumping up the team and keeping spirits high. Think of me as the cheerleader who's also all about getting stuff done. Let's nail this! ðŸ’ª

Ebony, thx for the kickoff on East Point Mall. The size issue could be a snag, but those positives sound promising. What's everyone else thinking?
Trevon: Trevon here. Logic Luminary cuz I light up facts in darkness. Don't get your hopes up on East Point Mall, it's a money pit with those ongoing costs. Let's not settle for flashy foot traffic and ignore the real deal. Maurice, pumping spirits won't balance our books. Ebony, strategize with numbers, not just perks.
Maurice: Valid point Trevon, gotta crunch the numbers indeed. Still, a vibrant student crowd at East Point can't be ignored; they're key to a buzzing place. And hey, quick waste disposal's a plus, right? Let's also gauge Starlight Valley and Cape James Beach, not just on cons but pros too. Thoughts, folks?
Maurice: Starlight Valley shines with easy waste disposal but lacks a student base and employable peeps. Cape James lacks parking and waste disposal ease but wins big on tourism and limited competitors. How do these key points weigh in for us? ðŸ¤” Trevon, thoughts on this mix? Ebony, strategize this puzzle for us!
Maurice: Ebony, crunching time! East Point's got the student vibe but might be crammed. Starlight's missing some vital vibes. Cape James? Touristy but tight on parking & trash. How's the budget & space fitting these pieces? Trevon, need your logic here, bud.
Trevon: Maurice, too optimistic. Starlight's cheap but dead. Cape James, tourists are great until they're not. Without enough staff, who's serving? East Point, at least it's alive, even if it costs. Prioritize what keeps us open, not just what looks good. Ebony, mixed up priorities much?
