Ebony: Hey all, Ebony here! ðŸ‘‹ Just a heads up, my badge says I'm all about detail and working together, so let's dive in! Anyone looked at the parking and space size for these spots? Feels like a good start. What do y'all think?
Ebony: Oi, sorry for the confusion earlier! Based on what I see, East Point Mall and Starlight Valley seems good on parking and space, but Cape James is a lil tight on parking. Thoughts?
Trevon: Trevon here, ye I'm the numbers guy. Quick, not always sweet. ðŸ™ƒ Parking? East Point Mall has it, Cape James, not so much. Let's not just stick to parking though. We got a lot to consider. Ebony, you're missing some key points.
Ebony: Right, Trevon, totally agre! We need to look at all the factors. Fyi East Point Mall has good foot traffic and a solid student population. Makes it promsing, don't ya think? What about tourist attraction at the other locations? 
Ebony: Maurice, Bryan, have we checked out the tourist numbers? Starlight Valley seems like a hotspot for that. Could mean big buisness during season. What do u guys have on that?
Trevon: Maurice, mate, tourist appeal? Only for Cape James. Big YES on that. Starlight? Dunno where u got ur info, but it ain't a magnet for tourists. Stick to the facts. And, Cape James might be tight on parking but it's low maintenance & big on tourists. Can't ignore that. Bryan, thoughts?
Trevon: Oops, looks like I spoke soon about Starlight. Thx for clearing that up, Trevon. How we feeling about the employee pool at these places? East Point sounds solid. Starlight, not much? Is that a dealbreaker?
