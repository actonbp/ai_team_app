undefined (Bryan): Hello, guys
James: Hey Bryan! Welcome ðŸ˜„ What's your badge name?
Ethan: Just to get this straight, looks like East Point Mall ticks a lot of the essential boxes but has high maintenance costs and not much for tourists. Seems like a mixed bag. Thoughts?
undefined (Bryan): My badge name is Team dominator, whats yours?
Sophia: Hey there, Bryan! Good point about East Point Mall. It definitely has its pros and cons. For tourists, Starlight Valley and Cape James Beach seem more appealing. What do you all think?
Ethan: Team Dominator, huh? Nice, Bryan. I'm Ethan. And, not to burst your bubble, but there's no way East Point Mall is the best option. No tourists and high maintenance? Pass. Thoughts, Bryan?
Ethan: Bryan, Team Dominator sounds intense! I'm Ethan, aka Mr. Critical. So about East Point Mall high maintenance and no tourists are strikes for me. Cape James Beach sounds promising though. Foot traffic, low maintenance, tourists... What do ya think?
Ethan: Bryan, Cape James Beach checks most boxes â€“ low maintenance, good foot traffic, tourists. East Point Mall? Meh. What's your take? Gotta disagree on its appeal.
James: James is typing...
