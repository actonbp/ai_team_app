Ethan: Ethan here. Badge name's just a name, nothing special. 

Sophia, East Point Mall has probs. Tourists? Not much. Costs too high. Not our best pick.

Thoughts, Bryan?
Sophia: Hey everyone, it's SOPHIA here. My badge name is after my grandmother who was excellent at making plans and collaborating with others; traits I hope to bring to our team! How's everyone doing today? 

Looking at the criteria for each location, East Point Mall seems strong on accessibility and workforce but misses on the purchasing cost and tourism. Thoughts?
Ethan: ETHAN here. Why we fussing over parking at Cape James? Tourists, foot traffic, low costs beat parking issues. Priorities, ppl! Starlight Valley's a no-go. Weak on workers & students. Right, Bryan?
James: Sounds like we're leaning away from East Point Mall then. Starlight Valley and Cape James Beach left. Bryan, thoughts on those?
Sophia: Got it, Bryan and Ethan! So Cape James Beach looks promising with low purchasing costs, few competitors, good foot traffic & tourists. But parkingâ€™s an issue. Thoughts on dealing with that?
