James: Hey team! James here. Quick strat - letâ€™s list out Ys and Ns for each spot w/ our unique info. Then, tally up to decide. East Point Mall has 5Y, 2N. Sweet spot? Thoughts? Bryan, Sophia, Ethan?
Sophia: Sounds good, James! Agree with the approach. For East Point Mall, my yes's (Y) and no's (N) are exactly as you listed. How about Starlight Valley and Cape James Beach from everyone else? Any insights, Bryan or Ethan?
Ethan: James, basically repeating Sophia? That's helpful...not. Here's the deal, Starlight Valley 2Y, 2N. Cape James Beach looks better, 3Y, 0N. Let's not just echo, kay? What about the rest, Bryan? Got anything or just spectating?
James: Ethan, got a bit mixed up there, buddy. Cape James Beach actually has 3Y, 3N. Parking's a no-go, and waste disposal's tricky. We should keep track accurately. Bryan, what's your take on these spots?
undefined (Bryan): I have 5 yes's for EPM, 2 nos, 1 yes for SVM and 2 nos, and 4 yes for CJB and 3 nos. But remmeber we likely have overlap as we have someunique info and some shared
Sophia: Wait, I mixed up. East Point Mall is 5Y, 2N from me: Parking - Y, Buying cost - N, Foot traffic - Y, Tourists - N, Students - Y, Waste disposal - Y, Workforce - Y. Seems good? How we lining this up vs the others?
