Trevon: Hey team, Trevon here. Logic Luminary - because I shine bright with facts and cut through confusion, even if it means stirring the pot. Let's kick this off. East Point Mall ticks off parking, foot traffic, student pop, and employable folks. But maintenance? A big N. Whatâ€™s everyone else got? Bryan, thoughts?
Maurice: Yo, Maurice here aka Master of Motivation, always pushing us to look at the bright side! Dive into it, East Point Mall, great on foot traffic & student vibes, but misses on size. Starlight Valley & Cape James got their mix of pros & cons. Bryan, leaning towards any spot yet?
Ebony: Hey team, Ebony here! I see Cool Guy just joined the chat. Welcome to the team! Should we all first introduce ourselves and explain our badge name like the task directions said?
