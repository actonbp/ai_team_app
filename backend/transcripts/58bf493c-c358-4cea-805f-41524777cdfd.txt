Maurice: Hey everyone, it's Maurice here, aka Master of Motivation! ðŸ‘‹ I believe my badge means I'm here to keep our spirits high and make sure we stay on track. Let's nail this! What's on everyone's mind about the locations?
Trevon: Hey, Trevon here, aka Logic Luminary. Means I'm all about the analysis and facts, even if it ruffles feathers. Let's dive into these locations, but ya know, don't get too optimistic Maurice.
Ebony: Hi all, Ebony here, pleased to meet you! I'm the Strategist Supreme, which means I'm all about laying out detailed plans and helping us navigate through our decisions with a clear strategy in mind. Let's get to analyzing these locations with the info we've got! ðŸ˜Š Looking forward to hearing everyone's thoughts.
Ebony: So, looking at our criteria, East Point Mall seems strong on foot traffic, student pop, and employable people but misses on purchasing cost & tourists. Thoughts? ðŸ¤”
Trevon: Ebony, your pointâ€™s kinda simplistic. East Point Mall's lack of tourists is a huge gap. Low maintenance at Cape James is key. Let's not ignore costs and competition for Starlight Valley either.
Maurice: Bryan, haven't heard ur thoughts yet! East Point Mall's packed with students and lots of ppl to hire but isn't big enough. Thoughts on size mattering here?
Maurice: Bryan, letâ€™s get ur badge info too, can't wait to know how ur gonna spice up this convo! East Point might be snug but attracts heaps of foot traffic. Plus, students and employable peeps aplenty! Weighing size vs. people... ðŸ¤” Thoughts?
