James: James is typing...
Trevon: Okay, jumping in. East Point Mall seems way ahead because of the mix: parking, foot traffic, student crowd, hiring pool, and waste disposal. Cape James Beach is next - good traffic, cheap to maintain, tourists. Starlight Valley's at the bottom, less appealing with no student or hiring pool advantage. Maurice, your take? Better not say Starlight's top just because it's cheap upfront.
Trevon: Maurice, your analysis is flawed. East Point Mall may have parking and foot traffic, but ignoring low maintenance and a tourist population at Cape James Beach? Shortsighted. Cape James is clear winner. Tourists spend more, lower costs mean higher profits. East Point's maintenance costs are a financial sinkhole. Starlight Valley's last, we agree, but not just because of its upfront cost - lack of a ready workforce is a fatal flaw. Ebony, bet you can't argue Cape James's potential over East Pointâ€™s supposed "advantages."
