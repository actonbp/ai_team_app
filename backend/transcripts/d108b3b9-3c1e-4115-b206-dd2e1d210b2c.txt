Ebony: Ebony is typing...
Ebony: Hey team, I see we are all here. Welcome.. Maybe we should all introduce ourselves and then jump into the task like the directions said?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Ebony: Hey, Maurice and Trevon. I'm Ebony, holding the badge 'Strategist Supreme,' which basically means I'm good at pulling plans together, eh? Let’s dive into these locations. 

East Point Mall sounds decent with strong foot traffic, a big student population, and good access to waste disposal. But it's missing on low purchasing cost and doesn't attract tourists much. What do y’all think?
Maurice: Hey team, Maurice here, aka Master of Motivation. Just means I'm good at keeping things upbeat! Alright, diving right in. East Point Mall looks solid with 5 pros like good foot traffic and lots of parking. Starlight Valley’s got a bit less going for it, only nailed it on parking and waste disposal—might be a tough sell.
Maurice: And Cape James Beach, well, it's a mixed bag with some nice tourist draw but missing on a couple of key points like parking and waste disposal. What’s your take?
Trevon: Hey Ebony and Maurice, Trevon here. Looking at the data, East Point Mall got some good points like lots of parking, foot traffic, and it’s great for students too. But yeah, no tourists and the maintenance costs might be an issue. Cape James Beach seems to have nothing major against it with good tourist visits and no noted cons yet.
Ebony: Yeah, Maurice, solid point on the student crowd at East Point. Cape James is def winning with the tourist and foot traffic angle. Seems like Cape James could be top, East Point second for the student flow, and Starlight kinda falls short? What do ya think?
Maurice: Cape James top, East Point second, Starlight last. Cape for tourists, East for students, Starlight meh. Done.
Ebony: Sounds good, Cape James, East Point, then Starlight. All set, let's move on.
