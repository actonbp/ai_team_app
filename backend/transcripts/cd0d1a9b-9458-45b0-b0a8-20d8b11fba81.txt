Sophia: Hey James and everyone! I'm Sophia, aka Strategist Supreme btw ðŸ˜Š. It means I'm all abt laying out the plans and strategies, making sure we've got a good roadmap to follow. James, abt East Point Mall, the foot traffics' a huge plus, esp with lots of students around. But, the space and the $1MM thing are potential downsides. Thoughts, Bryan?
James: Hey team! I'm James, your Master of Motivation. I'm here to keep our spirits up and push us towards making a killer decision on our next restaurant location. Let's crush this! ðŸ’ª Bryan, what's your take on East Point Mall's potential, given its strong foot traffic but smaller space?
Sophia: Bryan, do you think the high foot traffic at East Point can make up for its smaller size and higher cost? Also, how important is the student crowd for us?
James: Totally getcha Sophia! East Point's got the vibe with all the students but we gotta think size and $$$ too. Bryan, reckon size is a dealbreaker for East Point? Or can we work magic with the space?
