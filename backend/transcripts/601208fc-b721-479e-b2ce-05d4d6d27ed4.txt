Ethan: Hey guys, I'm Ethan. Just diving straight in, East Point Mall seems strong on parking, foot traffic, and has a solid student and employable population but falls short on maintenance and tourism. Might wanna consider these. Whatâ€™s everyone else thinking?
Ethan: James, got any thoughts on Starlight Valley? Lack of student pop and employable folks seems like a downside. Not seeing it as a top pick.
Ethan: Sophia, Cape James Beach seems like a hit on foot traffic, maintenance, and tourist pop. Still, gotta know about parking and the rest. What's the scoop there?
