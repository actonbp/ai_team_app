Ethan: Hey everyone, Ethan here. Just took a look at the criteria for East Point Mall, Starlight Valley, and Cape James Beach. Seriously, looks like we're dealing with a mixed bag here. Bryan, thoughts on East Point lacking a tourist population? Could be a big deal, no?
Ethan: Sophia, East Point is okay, but no tourists is a huge miss. Starlight Valley seems weak on demographics. Cape has perks but what about space & parking? Bryan, thoughts? Can't ignore these gaps.
Sophia: Hey Ethan, I'm Sophia. Totally get your concern about East Point Mall lacking a tourist population. Given our criteria, that could be a bit of a setback, especially since attracting tourists might have been a good revenue stream. But it does have a lot going for it like the student pop and foot traffic. How do you think it compares against the other locations considering all criteria? Bryan, would love to hear your take on this!
Sophia: James, I hear ya. Cape's lack of parking & uncertain space details are big red flags. Wonder if its other perks balance those out ü§î Bryan, got any insights on how critical space and parking are for our plans?
James: Hey team, James here! üöÄ Bryan, just saw your points. Agreed, having no tourists at East Point is a big miss. However, gotta consider all aspects. Cape sounds great but worries about parking & space? üèñÔ∏è What do you guys think? Ethan? Sophia?
James: Bryan, swinging it back to you! Parking & space are HUGE. East Point's tight on space, but has parking. Cape's short on both. Thoughts on prioritizing?
Sophia: Looks like each spot has its trade-offs. For East Point, no tourists & over budget but good on student pop & foot traffic. Starlight has tourists & foot traffic but lacks an employable pop. Cape balances cost and tourists but falls short on parking & space. Seems we need to decide what's most critical for us. Bryan, which of these do you feel we should prioritize?
Ethan: Looks to me like we're all missing the point about Cape's strengths. Yeah, parking and space are tight, but we're overlooking the gains from tourists and low maintenance costs. Bryan, seems you're too hung up on parking. Let's think bigger, no?
James: James is typing...
