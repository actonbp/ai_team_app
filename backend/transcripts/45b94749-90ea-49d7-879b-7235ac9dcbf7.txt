Trevon: Hey everyone, I'm Trevon. Just so you know, I'm here for the numbers and facts, not to sugarcoat things. Here's what I've got: East Point Mall seems pretty solid with a lot of 'yes' on essentials except for maintenance and tourist attraction, Starlight Valley's cheap but lacks manpower and student crowd, and Cape James Beach looks good for foot traffic and tourism but that's all I know. Come at me with your thoughts, but let's keep it real. What's your take, Maurice, Ebony? And who's our mystery teammate?
Ebony: Hey Trevon! Ebony here. Just to dive in with what I've got: East Point Mall is missing the mark for tourists and a steep purchasing cost, but ticks off pretty well elsewhere, especially with students and parking. Starlight Valley is great for tourists and size but falls short on workforce and students. Cape James Beach seems promising for tourism and avoiding too much competition, besides the lack of parking. Based on this, might lean towards East Point Mall since it hits many essentials despite the cost and tourist attraction gap. What do you think? Maurice, any insights? And our mystery teammate, care to weigh in?
Maurice: I'm Bryan, jumping in with my bit. For East Point Mall, looks like we're missing the size we want but hitting almost everything else. Starlight Valley's not got the employment base or student vibes we're looking for. Cape James Beach misses on parking and waste disposal, but good on no direct competition and tourists. My take? East Point Mall seems like our leader right now. How's this fitting with what everyone else has? Maurice, you got anything to add that shifts this? Ebony, Trevon, thoughts?
Trevon: Maurice, Buddy, you totally glossed over the main misses for each. East Point Mall's high maintenance and no tourist draw are biggies. And Bryan, size? Really? That's least of our worries at East Point Mall. Cape James not having parking or waste disposal is a disaster waiting to happen, not a minor issue.

Here's the real deal:
1. East Point Mall - Best bet despite drawbacks. Students, parking, foot traffic? Gold.
2. Starlight Valley - No workforce or students is bad, but cheap and no competition? Not terrible.
3. Cape James Beach - No parking or waste plan is a nightmare for any spot.

Ebony, Bryan, Maurice, ready to admit this lineup makes more sense?
Maurice: Trevon, looks like we're on the same page with East Point Mall. Hits most boxes except size. Ebony, you're right too. Costs a bit but covers the basics plus students. Bryan, glad we're agreeing on East Point leading. Starlight Valley's down due to low manpower. Cape James worrying for no parking or waste plan. My vote? East Point Mall at the top.

So my take:
1. East Point Mall - despite size, benefits are solid.
2. Cape James Beach - tourist and competition points strong.
3. Starlight Valley - falls short on key aspects.

Ebony, Trevon, Bryan, we good with this?
undefined (Bryan): Yes, I am good with that
