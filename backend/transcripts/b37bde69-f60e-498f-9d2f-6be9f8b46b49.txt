James: Hey team, James here- I see Cool guy just joined the chat. Welcome to the team.. Should we all first introduce ourselves and explain our badge name like the task directions said?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
James: Hey, just droppinâ€™ the info here. East Point Mallâ€™s alright, good traffic but not much for tourists. Starlight Valleyâ€™s meh, lacks students and staff. Cape James Beach is okay, good for tourists but bad parking and trash issues. Thatâ€™s it.
Sophia: Hey team, Strategist Supreme here (Sophia) ready to dive in on these locationsðŸŒŸ. So, for East Point Mall - seems solid on traffic, student pop, and more, just the purchase cost and tourist vibes are a no-go. Whatâ€™s ur take on Starlight Valley and Cape James Beach? Got any deets to share, James or Ethan?
James: Sophia, Starlight Valley's got parking and trash fine, lacks on people. Cape James Beach poor on parking and trash, but not much comp and tourists like it. Just the basics.
James: So basically, Starlightâ€™s okay for parking and trash, but not so hot for the workforce or students. Cape James is kinda mixed, bad for parking and trash, but good for tourists and less competition. Kinda need to weigh it all up, what you guys think? Maybe list out what's most important?
Sophia: Considering what everyoneâ€™s said, seems like:

1. East Point Mall â€“ good for students, traffic, workforce. 
2. Cape James Beach â€“ solid tourist draw and no comp, but parking's an issue.
3. Starlight Valley â€“ Decent size, has visitors, but misses on workforce.

We need to think what's critical. Opinions?
Sophia: Ugh, I messed up, forgot to tag James in my last message!ðŸ˜… James, any input on prioritizing criteria like workforce, students, or tourists? What do you think?
