Ethan: Sorry James, but I'm with on this. Can't just count Ys & Ns. Look at East Point Mall, hits most marks but how we gonna ignore the high maint costs? Plus, no tourist draw. Big misses there.
Ethan: Alright team, let's not waste time. First, let's each drop the top pros and cons for each location based on our unique info. Then tally up the yes's and no's. Remember, we gotta share what we know. I'm saying East Point Mall lacks in low maintenance costs and tourist attraction, but nails pretty much everything else. What's everyone else got? James, Sophia, sdbsfb, lemme hear your thoughts.
