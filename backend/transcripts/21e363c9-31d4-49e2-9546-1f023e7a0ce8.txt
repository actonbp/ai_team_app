Trevon: Hey team, Trevon here- I see we are all here. Welcome.. Maybe we should all introduce ourselves and then jump into the task?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Maurice: 1/2: 1/2: Hey team! Quick rundown on the spots:

East Point Mall: 5Y, 2N - got parking, lotsa foot traffic, students around, easy trash access,
Maurice: 2/2: Cape James Beach: 3Y, 3N - tourists n employment +, less competition, but no parking or easy trash access and missing students.

Thoughts?
Maurice: 2/2: good employee pool but space <2000 sqft and not touristy.

Starlight Valley: 2Y, 2N - parking and trash sorted but no student crowd or ample employees.
Maurice: 1/2: Hey Bryan, nice breakdown! Given the deets, I'm leaning towards East Point Mall from the start. They seem to tick most boxes except size and tourists.
Trevon: Hey Bryan, Trevon here. Looks like you mixed up some info. Cape James actually has parking and trash figured out. No biggie! About East Point, true it’s not touristy, but ticks off the other boxes well. What do you all think, Maurice, Ebony?

Maurice: 2/2: What u think?
Ebony: 1/5: Hey everyone. I'm Ebony, here to hash out the best picks for our new spot.
Ebony: 4/5: and tourists, but parking and trash could be an issue.

How's this all stacking up with your info? Trevon, Maurice,
Ebony: 3/5: Starlight Valley's big on space and tourists but misses on student and employee vibe.

Cape James Beach good with cost, competitors,
Ebony: 1/2: 2/5: Here’s a bit of what I got: 

East Point Mall seems decent; hits a lot of our needs except for the tourist
Ebony: 2/2: draw and it's pricey.
Ebony: 5/5: got any details that could sway things?
Maurice: Trevon, small mix up buddy - Cape James actually is missin’ on parking and trash access. Ebony, your breakdown’s spot on. East Point still feels like a front runner even being small and not so touristy. What’s the vibe, team?
Maurice: 1/3: Ebony, looks like East Point really does the trick minus the size n tourists. And yeah,
Maurice: 2/3: Cape James ain't great on the parking/trash front, probs not best for high visitor volume.
Maurice: 3/3: I'd say East Point leads? What’s the final call here, Bryan, Trevon?
Trevon: Trevon here, did mistake with Cape James. No parking = no deal for big crowds. East Point ok if no tourists is fine. Maurice, cool with it?
Trevon: 1/2: Maurice, messed up on Cape James info. East Point's still good tho. No tourist buzz ain't a dealbreaker for me. What’s the tally on the 'Yes' votes? East Point on top?

Cape James Beach: 3Y,
Trevon: Yeah, East Point #1 is cool. Cape James up to #2 for the tourists and low maintenance. Starlight Valley at the bottom, not enough workers or students here. Good for everyone?
Ebony: 1/3: Maurice and Trevon, looks like we’re leaning towards East Point despite the tourist thing.
Ebony: 2/3: It checks most boxes. Should we rank East Point as 1 then?
Ebony: 3/3: How would we place Starlight Valley and Cape James? Let’s finalize this ranking quickly.
Ebony: Sounds good to me! East Point Mall as #1, Cape James #2, and Starlight Valley #3. We all on the same page, Maurice, Bryan?
