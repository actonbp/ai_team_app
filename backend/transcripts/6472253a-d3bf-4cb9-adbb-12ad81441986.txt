Maurice: Hey team, Maurice here! Just a quick run-through on these locations with our criteria in mind. 

East Point Mall sounds promising with parking, foot traffic, student presence, and employability all ticked. But, it's not big enough space-wise. 

Starlight Valleyâ€™s got parking and waste disposal covered but misses out on a student pop and a solid labor force.

Cape James lacks parking and waste disposal facilities, but it's strong on tourists and has a good labor pool without too many competitors.

Ready to dive deeper into this with ya'll! Thoughts?
