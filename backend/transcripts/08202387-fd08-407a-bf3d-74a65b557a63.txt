James: Hey team, James here! ðŸ’¥ Let's break down our spots based on yes's and no's. Sharing my bits first: East Point Mall looks solid on parking, foot traffic, students, waste disposal, and workforce. Starlight's got parking and waste sorted but falls short on the workforce. Cape James misses on parking and waste disposal but wins on low competition and tourists. Thoughts? Bryan, Sophia, Ethan?
James: Hey Bryan, got any insights on the size or cost aspects? How are the spots looking on those fronts? ðŸ‘€
Sophia: James, based on ur info, Starlight Valley is over 2000 sqft, which is great! Cape James is under 1MM, making it affordable. East Point Mall doesn't meet the under 1MM criteria. Helps any?
Ethan: James, ur missing some key points. East Point's maintenance costs r high, not good. Starlight lacks enough ppl to hire. Cape James is solid on tourists and maintenance. Bryan, thoughts?
