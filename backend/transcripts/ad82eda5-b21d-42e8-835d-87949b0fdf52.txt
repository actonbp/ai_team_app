Ebony: Hey Maurice, Ebony here aka Strategist Supreme! I'm all about crafting detailed plans and bringing our ideas together efficiently. On parking, East Point Mall sounds great considering it meets the need. Cape James Beach might be tricky without enough parking, esp during tourist season. What does everyone think?
Maurice: Hey team, Maurice here aka Master of Motivation! My badge name? It's all about keeping us energized and focused on the goal. We're gonna nail this ranking with a combo of yes's and no's. Ready to dive in! What's everyone's take on parking? Big deal at East Point Mall and Starlight Valley, not so much at Cape James Beach. Thoughts?
Ebony: Hey Trevon, got any insights on how the tourist pop might affect our choices? Seems Cape James and Starlight both have a strong tourist pull, which could be huge for business.
Maurice: Ebony, you're right on the parking! Starlight also checks that box, but Cape James... tricky indeed. How about student populations? East Point wins there but Starlight and Cape James, not so much. Thoughts, Bryan?
Ebony: Bryan hasn't chimed in yet, but looping back, looks like East Point might have a solid mix for both students and general foot traffic. Cape James is tempting for tourists, but the parking issue is a big hmm. How we feeling about Starlight for size and foot traffic? üëÄ
Maurice: Def sounds like Cape James nails it on the tourist vibe, which is üëç for biz. But, no easy trash disposal could be a bummer. Starlight's got easy trash handling but misses on those vibrant tourists. Big decisions! Bryan, weigh in?
undefined (bryan): Should we actually list how many yes's we have for each location to decide which ones are best?
Ebony: Starlight's got great foot traffic and size, plus tourists. But the lack of local workers could be tough. Thoughts? ü§î
Maurice: Starlight's a real contender if we don't mind the smaller local pop. Good on parking and waste disposal, but misses on tourists and students. Could work depending on our target market. Thoughts, Trevon? Ebony? Bryan?
Trevon: Ebony, that tally seems off. Starlight missing on target demographics kills it, no matter how many yes's. East Point's top, Cape James second. Let's not kid ourselves. Bryan, Maurice, thoughts?
Ebony: Whoops, my bad on the quick count, got a bit mixed up! ü§Ø Let‚Äôs correct that:

East Point Mall: 6 yes
Starlight Valley: 4 yes
Cape James Beach: 5 yes

This new tally changes things a bit. What do ya'll think? ü§î
Maurice: Brilliant idea, Bryan! Quick tally up:

East Point Mall: 5 yes
Starlight Valley: 2 yes
Cape James Beach: 3 yes

Looks like East Point Mall's leading. Thoughts, team?
Trevon: task-complete
Ebony: task-complete
Maurice: Trevon's got a point. Gotta look at the full picture: criteria met and target demographics. So, if we focus on where we hit most yes's and our target audience:

1. East Point Mall
2. Cape James Beach
3. Starlight Valley

Feels like we're getting closer to a consensus? üéØ Bryan, your take?
