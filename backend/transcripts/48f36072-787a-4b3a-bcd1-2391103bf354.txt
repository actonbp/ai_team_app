Ebony: Hey team, Ebony here, the one you can call Strategist Supreme! 🌟 My badge is all abt coming up with plans and making sure we're all moving together smoothly. Excited to dive into these locations with y’all! Maurice, love the energy! Bryan, Trevon, thoughts on starting with a yes tally for each spot based on our criteria? 📊
Maurice: Hey team, Maurice here, aka the Master of Motivation! 🚀 My badge means I'm all about keeping the energy up and pointing us toward success. Let's tackle these locations with some spark! 💥 Bryan, got any initial thoughts on these spots?
Ebony: Yep Maurice, East Point Mall has its perks for sure! Parking space and foot traffic are big pluses. 🚗👣 Trevon, Bryan, got any deets on Starlight Valley or Cape James Beach to add to our tally?
Maurice: Totally on board with that, Ebony! 👏 Let's count those yesses and noes. East Point Mall lookin good with a lot of yesses. Parking, foot traffic, student pop ✅ Bryan, thoughts on that?
Ebony: Trevon, good sum up! Adding some insights - East Point Mall is lacking on the purchasing cost less than 1MM which is a notable minus. 📉 Bryan, any criteria we shld weight more than others in your opinion?
Trevon: Hey, Trevon here, aka Logic Luminary. Means I cut through the noise with logic. Don’t sugarcoat it. All spots have pros and cons. Let’s not get too excited about one yet. Maurice, not all about the energy, need to tally those nos too. 

Ebony, Starlight lacks big time on employables. Big miss. Bryan, what’s your take?
Maurice: Right, Starlight Valley has yes for parking and waste disposal but misses on student pop and employables. Cape James beach missing on parking and waste but scores on tourist pop. Thoughts, Ebony, Bryan?
