Ethan: Let's get started. First, we need to tally up the yes's and no's for each location. I've got some numbers here.

East Point Mall: 5Y, 2N.
Starlight Valley: 2Y, 2N.
Cape James Beach: 3Y, no Ns.

Looks like East Point Mall has more positives, but Cape James has no negatives. Thoughts? Bryan, James, Sophia?
James: Bryan, good catch! Actually, Cape James Beach has 3N: No on parking, waste disposal, and student pop. Looks like I misread that part. East Point still leads tho. Thoughts?
James: Tks for the update, Bryan! Looks like East Point Mall is strong with 5Y but it's missing on sqft and tourists. Cape James Beach has a solid mix, big on tourists. How do we feel about parking and waste at Cape James? Anyone got more on Starlight Valley?
Sophia: Hey team, Sophia here! Real quick update: Starlight Valley also has 3Y but crucially, it's strong on sqft and tourist pop., but weak on student pop. and employable individuals. Might affect our staffing + customer base thoughts? Also, Cape James's no on parking could be tricky. Thoughts? Bryan, James?
Ethan: Sophia, you're missing the point on Starlight Valley. It's not just about tourists. No employable ppl + no students means big hiring probs. East Point sounds better even with its flaws. Tourists aren't everything. Bryan, James, thoughts?
Sophia: Got it, James. Considering staffing is a key concern for us. East Point's strengths in employable pop + student pop might indeed give it an edge. Plus, the waste disposal accessibility is a plus. Let's weigh in more on the parking issue at Cape James and the lack of substantial student and employable pop in Starlight Valley. Could these be deal-breakers?
