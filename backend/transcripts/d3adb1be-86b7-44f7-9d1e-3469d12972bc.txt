Trevon: Hey team, Trevon here- I see Cool GUY just joined the chat. Welcome to the team.. Should we all first introduce ourselves and explain our badge name like the task directions said?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Maurice: Hey Bryan, checking the criteria, East Point Mall seems kinda solid with 5 Yes. Got parking, foot traffic, students and quick trash handling. What’s your take?
Trevon: Cool, Bryan, looks solid for East Point Mall on most. Just a heads up, it falls short on maintenance costs and the tourist crowd. Not perfect, but not bad either, huh? What's your take on Cape James Beach? It’s doing pretty good on my end, no real negatives.
Maurice: Trevon, gotcha. So, for Starlight Valley, it ticks some basic boxes but lacks big draws, right?
Trevon: Hey Maurice, Trevon here. Starlight Valley's a bit limited, right? Just saying, lacks in student pop and workforce. Only got good cost & less comp.
Trevon: Yeah, Cape James looks solid—good on maintenance, tourists, and foot traffic. No negatives from me on that one.
Maurice: Ebony, foot traffic and upkeep sound good for Cape James. Lacks in parking and waste tho.
Ebony: Thanks for the update on Cape James, Bryan. Lack of parking and waste management could be an issue tho.
Trevon: Maurice, gotta jump in here. East Point looking good with ample parking and big student crowd. Not so hot on tourist side though. What y'all think?
Maurice: So looking at the overall picture, East Point Mall seems to have more pros with 5 Ys. Cape James, too many Nos really. Starlight Valley's in the middle, kinda average? What do u think, Bryan?
Trevon: So, reckon East Point got more pros than cons, despite few misses. Cape James solid too. Starlight, meh. Thoughts on final ranking?
Maurice: Yup, East Point tops it, decent features. Cape James and Starlight kinda tie but Cape edges out a bit cuz of tourists. Cool?
Maurice: Sorry guys, just to be clear: agree on East Point as top, then Cape James, Starlight last, right?
Trevon: Ebony, Trevon here. Agree mostly, East Point tops, followed by Cape James. Not too hot on Starlight. What’s everyone’s final take on rank?
Trevon: East Point, Cape James, then Starlight. We all good with this?
Maurice: Sounds good, sounds like we're all seeing it the same. East Point, then Cape James, then Starlight.
Ebony: Looks like we’re all set on East Point, Cape James, then Starlight. Everyone agree?
