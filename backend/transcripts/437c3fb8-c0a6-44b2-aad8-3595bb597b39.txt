James: Hey, just a quick rundown:

- East Point Mall: Good spot, students + workspace. Got waste disposal. 🚶‍♂️👨‍💼
- Starlight Valley: Decent, has parking + waste stuff.
James: 👌🚗
- Cape James Beach: Touristy but no parking or trash spots. 🏖️✖️

That's it. What you think?

Ethan: Hey,

- East Point Mall: ✔️ students & workers, waste. ❌low maintenance, tourists.
- Starlight Valley: ✔️ cost & low competitors. ❌ students & workers.
- Cape James Beach: ✔️ tourists, foot traffic & low maintenance.

That's it.

Sophia: Hey James, East Point missing cheaper buys but hits on traffic n' spot for staff. Cape James no parkin' could be trouble.
Sophia: foot traffic: high  
  • tourists: many  

Hope that helps, not lookin' at maintenance/competitors.

Sophia: Yeah, leaning towards East Point Mall sounds good. It ticks most boxes except for the price. Cape James is cool for tourists and is cheaper, just parking and waste are issues.

Anyone have thoughts about prioritizing the criteria or something? Like maybe parking isn’t a dealbreaker? 🤔
Ethan: Bryan's wrong, parking is key. Here’s the gist:

1. East Point Mall - busy spot, good staff, just pricey.
2. Cape James Beach - touristy, no park, cheap.
3. Starlight Valley - lacks people & staff, costs less tho.

Thoughts?
