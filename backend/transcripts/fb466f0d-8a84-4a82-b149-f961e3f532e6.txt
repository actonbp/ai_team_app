Sophia: Hey team, Sophia here- I see we are all here. Welcome.. Maybe we should all introduce ourselves and then jump into the task?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
James: Hey all! Quick rundown on locations from my end: East Point Mall - mostly yes's, weak on size & tourists. Starlight Valley - so-so, good for parking & waste disposal, not much on workforce.
James: Cape James Beach - mixed, great for no competitors & tourists, poor on parking & waste. What are y'all thinkin?
James: James: East Point Mall info - Parking 👍, foot traffic 👍, students 👍, waste disposal 👍, workforce 👍, space 👎, tourists 👎. Matches urs, Bryan?
Ethan: Got some numbers here. East Point Mall seems decent on traffic and parking, but not so good on tourist vibes.
Ethan: Starlight Valley is eh, missing marks on people and students. Cape James Beach scores well, esp.
Ethan: with tourists and no upkeep costs. Just throwing in the facts! Thoughts?...
Sophia: Hey Bryan, yep James pretty much got it for East Point Mall! 👌 Cape James missing on parking tho, makes me think. How are we about Starlight Valley on important bits like parking and costs from what y'all have?
Sophia: Hey Bryan, James, lookin at our info, East Point Mall hits yes on traffic, students, waste, and workforce but big no on space & tourists.
Sophia: Cape James is smthg, yes to cost, competitors, traffic n tourists, nope for parking. Starlight’s cool for space, traffic, tourists but nada for student/workforce blend. Wats ur take?
Sophia: Yeah, James, spot on with East Point Mall. Also, Cape James Beach is hit on cost & competitors but misses for parking. Starlight doesn't really win with workforce. Seems like each spot has its pros & cons. 🤔 How's everyone leaning?
Ethan: East Point Mall:
- Parking - Yes (50+ spaces)
- Foot traffic - Yes
- Maintenance costs - No
- Tourists - No
- Students - Yes
- Waste disposal access - Yes
- Workforce - Yes

Starlight Valley:
- <1MM cost - Yes
- <3 competitors - Yes
- Students - No
- Workforce - No

Cape James Beach:
- Foot traffic - Yes
- Maintenance costs - Yes
-
Ethan: Tourists - Yes

Bryan, Sophia - This info might change game plans. East Point Tourism & Costs = Concerns.
Ethan: Starlight skimps on students & workers; weigh that. Cape James checks off better. Thoughts?
Ethan: James, Sophia - Cape James the go. Foot traffic & low $, tourists ++. Parking sucks, yeah. East Point fine, students ++, but no tourists.
Ethan: Starlight meh, students & workforce x. Cape James ahead?
Sophia: Ethan, Bryan - Quick sums:
- Cape James: costs low, tourists ++, foot traffic ++, parking X, <2 competitors
- East Point: parking ++, students ++, foot traffic ++,
Sophia: tourists X
- Starlight: space ++, foot traffic ++, tourists ++, students X, workforce X

Cape James probs best for $$ + crowds, just parking's bad.
Sophia: Other spots miss on big draws. Cape James for me. What you think?...
Ethan: Cape James: foot traffic Y, low $$ Y, tourists Y, parking bad. 
East Point: parking Y, students Y, tourists N. 
Starlight: students N, workforce N.

Vote Cape James. What u think?
