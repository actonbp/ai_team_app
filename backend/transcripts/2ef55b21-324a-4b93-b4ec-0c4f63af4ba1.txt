Ebony: Yeah Bryan, Cape James seems hot except for that parking issue. East Point good but that price tag... Starlight not bad, missing some key aspects tho. We thinking Cape James, East Point, then Starlight for the ranking? What do you all think?
Ebony: Ebony is typing...
Ebony: Hey team, Ebony here- I see we are all here. Welcome.. Maybe we should all introduce ourselves and then jump into the task?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Maurice: Hey Trevon, noted about East Point Mall. High foot traffic sounds decent. Not too keen on Cape James Beach.
Trevon: Trevon here. I'm mostly on the numbers side. East Point Mall's got some perks like 50+ parking spots and good foot traffic, but the maintenance costs are high.
Maurice: Yeah Ebony, East Point's a headache. Starlight Valley? Meh, students and jobs aren't great. Just considering it all.
Ebony: Hey Trevon, Maurice, it's Ebony. East Point Mall's got decent foot traffic and enough parking, but the costs and lack of tourists are a bit of a drag. Just weighing the pros and cons here.
Ebony: Yeah, Maurice, East Point Mall sounds solid on some fronts. Starlight Valley though, good space and tourist flow, might miss on potential employees tho. How do we see this balancing out?
Ebony: Maurice, Starlight's got tourists and space but weak job market. Cape James might be better - beach, costs, less competition.
Maurice: Good points, Bryan. Starlight's okayish on access and parking but lags behind on workforce. East Point might lead despite drawbacks, huh? Thoughts?
Ebony: Cape James is okay, fewer rivals and cheaper. Parking could be an issue.
Maurice: Yeah, Ebony, parking sucks at Cape James. Low comp's got its perks tho. Still thinking...
