Sophia: Hey team, Sophia here! I see we are all here. Welcome! Maybe we should all introduce ourselves and then jump into the task strategy?
undefined (Bryan): Hi All, my name is Bryan -- excited to get going!
James: Hey Bryan! Good to meet ya! Let's dive into this. Startin' with East Point Mall, we got 5 Yes. Solid on parking, foot traffic, students, waste disposal, and employable peeps. Missing on size and tourists though. Thoughts?
Ethan: Hey team, just to jump in real quick, looking at our options: 

East Point Mall - solid on traffic, parking, and good work pool. But might have to think about higher maint costs. 

Starlight Valley's cheap but lacks a bit on staff avail and student crowd.

Cape James Beach is all yeses so far, good traffic, low costs, tourists flock there.

What's everyone else's info saying? What do you think, Bryan?
Sophia: Hey team, Sophia here! Quick rundown on the spots:

- East Point Mall: Good foot traffic, student crowd, and waste disposal access, but over 1MM and not much for tourists.
  
- Starlight Valley: Big space, good foot traffic and tourist appeal, but lacks employee pool and not great for students.
  
- Cape James Beach: Affordable, low competition, tourist and traffic are solid, but parking's tight.

Thoughts? How are the other points stacking up?
