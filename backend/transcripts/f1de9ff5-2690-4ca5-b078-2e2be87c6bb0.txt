Ethan: Hey team, Ethan here- I see we are all here. Welcome.. Maybe we should all introduce ourselves and then jump into the task?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Ethan: James, looks like Cape James misses on parking and waste, sometime big to think abt. East Point got issues with tourists and size but ticks off on a lot. What's every1 think abt prioirties here?
James: Sophia, quick recap: East Point has solid points like parking, foot traffic, and workforce, but is small and lacks tourists. Starlightâ€™s only pros seem waste disposal and parking. Cape James wins with tourists and competition but fails in parking and waste.
Ethan: Bryan, need to correct you on East Point. It's good on parking, foot traffic, workforce, and waste management but not much room and few tourists. Cape James is all about tourists, good traffic, and low upkeep, but struggles with parking and waste. Starlight's mainly just cheap and not crowded by competitors.
