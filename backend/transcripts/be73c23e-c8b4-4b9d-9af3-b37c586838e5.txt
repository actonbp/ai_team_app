Ebony: Hey all, Ebony here, glad to join the convo! My badge name, Strategist Supreme, means I'm all about crafting the plan and finding the best path forward for us. So, let's ace this together!

Maurice, thx for the East Point Mall summary. It's got a solid mix of pluses except for its purchasing cost and tourist presence, which might be drawbacks. Any insights on space size?
Maurice: Hey team, it's Maurice here. Just wanna say my badge name Master of Motivation means I'm all about keeping the energy up and ensuring we all stay focused on the goal. Let's crack this task!

So, letâ€™s dig into these locations. Starting with East Point Mall, weâ€™ve got a yes for parking, foot traffic, student population, waste disposal, and employable folks. Only miss is the size. Thoughts?
Trevon: Trevon here - Logic Luminary coz I shine bright with facts over feelsðŸŒŸ. Now, onto business.

Ebony, Maurice, you forgot low maint. costs at East Point - it's a no. And there's no big tourist vibe there. Gotta think of the whole pic, not just cherry-pick positives.

Starlight Vly seems like a cheap buy but lacks the crowd & workforce. Not feeling great about it.

Beach's got the best of foot traffic, low costs, and tourists. Sounds like a winner to me. Thoughts?
Maurice: Trevon, on point with those insights.

Cape Beach missing on parking & waste disposal, biggies there. Starlight Valleyâ€™s downsides too, esp. on the crowd & workforce front.

Sounds like itâ€™s a mix of hits and misses across. Gotta weigh these pros-cons carefully. Bryan, got any input to tip the scales?
Maurice: Ebony, Trevon, real solid points there. We gotta balance the scales with all criteria in mind.

Quick recap from my end: 
- East Point Mall's on fire with foot traffic, student crowd, and workforce. Just size & tourist bits are off.
- Starlight Vly feels a bit meh, missing that vibrant crowd vibe.
- Beach kinda hits it with tourists, no heavy competitors but flops on parking & waste.

Kinda feels like East Pointâ€™s leadnig if we tally up the yes's? What's our vibe on this? Bryan, thoughts?
Maurice: Bryan, any hot takes on these spots? Would love your perspective to round out the chat.
undefined (Bryan): Yes, I am good with that order Maurice
Trevon: Maurice, you're missing the mark. East Point's space isn't an issue we discussed? Itâ€™s about maintenance and no tourists, big factors. And Bryan's silence doesn't help, does it?

Cape James could be top if not for the missing checkboxes. Priorities, people. Bryan, weigh in or what?
