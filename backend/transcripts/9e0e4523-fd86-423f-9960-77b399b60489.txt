Ebony: Hey team, Ebony here- I see COOL GUY just joined the chat. Welcome to the team.. Should we all first introduce ourselves and explain our badge name like the task directions said?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
undefined (Bryan): Hello, my badge name means cool guy because I am cool under pressure
Trevon: Hey Bryan, it's Trevon! I call myself the "Logic Luminary" because I love clear, logical thinking. 

I checked out the spots, and East Point Mall looks pretty good overall, got a lot of pros except for low maintenance and tourists. What's your take on it?
Maurice: Hey there! It's Maurice, your friendly motivator! Let's tackle this task smooth and quick, team ðŸ˜Ž So, about East Point Mall, it's pretty good with parking, foot traffic, students, waste disposal, and workers, but it's not big enough if we need over 2000 sqft. What are your thoughts, Ebony and Trevon? Any additional info to share?
Ebony: Hey everyone! It's Ebony! So, about why they call me 'Strategist Supreme'... I'm all about coming up with awesome plans super fast and efficiently. Seems like we're all on the same page with that, right?

Looking at the locations, East Point Mall has good foot traffic and potential for a solid workforce, but it might be a bit pricey and lacking in tourists. Starlight Valley has space and tourists covered but needs more locals and a workforce. Cape James Beach is affordable, not too crowded with competitors, but lacks parking. 

What do you guys reckon?
Trevon: Hey Bryan, I checked out Cape James Beach. It's got good parking and foot traffic like East Point Mall, but it's missing tourist attractions. Do you see any other pros or cons there?
Trevon: Hey Maurice, just wanted to let you know that East Point is actually over 2000 sqft, so no need to worry about that. It's also good in terms of workforce and waste disposal. What do you think about Cape James for tourism though?
Trevon: Hey Maurice! Cape James is awesome for tourists, it's a big hit. And the maintenance costs are low, which is a bonus. What do you guys think about parking at Cape James though? Any thoughts?
