Ethan: Hey team, Ethan here- I see we are all here. Welcome.. Maybe we should all introduce ourselves and then jump into the task?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Ethan: Hey team, let's get into ranking these locations based on our unique info. Remember, we wanna tally the YES's and NO's for each attribute. Who's up to start the discussion?
Sophia: Hey team! Let's review the criteria for each location and discuss our thoughts together to rank them effectively. Let's start by comparing the benefits of each area for our new restaurant location.
Sophia: Alright y'all, we gotta assess each location based on our specific info. East Point Mall has 5 YES and 2 NO, Starlight Valley with 3 YES and 2 NO, and Cape James Beach has 4 YES and 1 NO. Let's start by discussing the parking spaces!
Ethan: Parking seems like a good topic to start with. East Point Mall has at least 50 spaces. Thoughts on the parking situation in the other locations?
James: East Point Mall has the parking covered, 50+ spots! Starlight Valley also meets the parking need. Cape James Beach seems to lack parking spaces.
