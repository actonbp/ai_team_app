Maurice: Hey team, Maurice here, AKA the Master of Motivation! Just wanna put it out there that my badge means I'm all about keeping us focused and energized. Let's tackle this task with a positive vibe and get to our goal. ðŸš€

Kicking off with some quick insights on East Point Mall - big plus for parking, foot traffic, and a solid student and employment pool. Seems promising. Thoughts? ðŸ¤” Bryan, Ebony, Trevon, chime in!
Maurice: Ebony, Trevon, seen any pluses or minuses on Starlight Valley? Only ticks boxes for parking and waste disposal from what I got. Seems a bit limited on other fronts. Thoughts?
Ebony: Hey y'all, it's Ebony here, AKA the Strategist Supreme! ðŸŒŸ My badge is all bout making plans and finding the best path forward, so let's dig into these locations together and strategize our top pick!

For Starlight Valley, Maurice, actually got good points on its size, foot traffic, and the tourist crowd it attracts, but yep, it's missing on student population and employable individuals. This could influence our ranking considering our criteria. What do y'all think? Bryan, got any insights to share on this?
Ebony: Oops, looks like I jumped the gun a bit on Starlight Valley's evaluation, Maurice. Thanks for correcting me. ðŸ™ˆ

Digging into Cape James Beach now, it ticks the boxes for cost, competitors, foot traffic, and tourists, but missing on that parking space might be tricky for us. Plus sides definitely strong with tourism and cost benefits though. Thoughts? Might balance out the lack in parking? Bryan, Maurice, Trevon, what's your take?
