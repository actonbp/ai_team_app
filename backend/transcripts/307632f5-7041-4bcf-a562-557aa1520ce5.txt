Ethan: Hey team, Ethan here. Heads up, I'm the numbers guy, short and to the point. And yeah, might rub some the wrong way. Let's dive in. What's yr thoughts on East Point Mall? Seems decent on foot traffic and employables to me.
Ethan: East Point Mall kinda misses on low maint costs, not too thrilled. Cape James Beach looks stronger on those low costs + tourists. Thoughts, James?
Sophia: Hey, it's Sophia here, lovers of details at your service! ðŸ‘‹ Taking a look at East Point Mall, besides strong points on foot traffic and potential employees, it doesn't exactly hit the mark on purchasing cost and it's not a tourist hotspot. Cape James, with its advantages in cost and tourist appeal, might indeed outshine despite the parking space issue. What's Bryan's take on this?
