I'm tagged as the "Strategist Supreme" so hope to help us navigate these choices well. 😄  Starting with some info on East Point Mall, it's got good foot traffic, plenty of parking, and a lot of potential hires but misses on the tourist aspect and is above our budget. What’s everyone else’s thoughts or info on the locations?

Trevon: Heads up, Maurice, Ebony, Bryan, quick tally from what we've discussed:

East Point Mall seriously strong on several counts but the cost and tourist numbers are drawbacks.

Starlight Valley is budget-friendly, less competition, but lack of qualified workforce and students is an issue.

Cape James Beach nabbing the robust foot traffic, low maintenance, and solid tourist numbers,
Trevon: but might struggle with parking.

How's this aligning with everyone’s view? Ready to start ranking these?
undefined (Bryan): Yes, based on all of this info...what do you guys have for rankings?
Maurice: Ranking:

1. East Point Mall - most criteria met, except cost/tourists.
2. Cape James Beach - tourists, low comp, bad parking.
3. Starlight Valley - lacks workforce/students.

Final ranking confirmed. Done.
Maurice: Yup, sounds about right Trevon. Let's go over to ranking. Here’s my take:

1. **East Point Mall:** Strong on key aspects minus tourists and cost.
2. **Cape James Beach:** Great for tourists and low comp, but the parking and waste disposal is tricky.
3.
Maurice: **Starlight Valley:** Lacking in key personnel availability and student presence, even if it meets other criteria.

Agree with this setup or any tweaks needed?
Trevon: Fine. Ranking’s good. Agree w Maurice:

- 1: East Point Mall (5Y-2N)
- 2: Cape James Beach (3Y-0N)
- 3: Starlight Valley (2Y-2N)
