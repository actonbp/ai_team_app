Sophia: Hey team, Sophia here- I see Cool GUy just joined the chat. Welcome to the team.. Should we all first introduce ourselves and explain our badge name like the task directions said?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
James: 2/2: Could be promising despite the size issue. What does everyone else have on it?
James: 1/2: 1/2: Hey team, I'm James! Keeping things rolling. Starting off, let's talk about East Point Mall, got a decent mix here with 5 yes's like plenty of parking, good foot traffic,
James: 2/2: and a solid potential workforce.
Ethan: Hey James, Ethan here. East Point Mall's okay, good parking and foot traffic, but remember higher upkeep costs, not great for tourists. What about Cape James Beach? Looks all good, tons of tourists, low costs.
Sophia: Hey James! Sophia here. Yeah, East Point Mall seems solid especially with that workforce and foot traffic. But the lack of a large tourist population might be a downer? What do you think about Cape James Beach? Got great tourist and foot traffic, plus only 1 direct competitor around.
Ethan: Sophia, Cape James looks fine. Maintenance & tourist traffic check out. Starlight Valley? Only 2 yes, risky. What's the plan?
