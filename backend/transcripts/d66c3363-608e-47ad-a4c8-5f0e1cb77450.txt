Sophia: Hey team, Sophia here. Quick rundown on what I found:

- **East Point Mall** seems like a solid option with plenty of parking, heavy foot traffic, a significant student population, easy waste disposal, and lots of potential employees. But, it's over budget.

- **Starlight Valley** has great size, good foot traffic, and attracts tourists. Yet, doesn’t have a strong candidate pool or students around. 

- **Cape James Beach** is budget-friendly, has fewer competitors, and both tourists and locals love the area. Parking could be an issue, though.

Given these points, I'd lean towards ranking them:
1. **East Point Mall** for its overall fit despite the cost.
2. **Cape James Beach** due to its unique location appeal and affordability.
3. **Starlight Valley**, mainly because of the lack in employable population and students, which might impact operation and marketing.

What do y'all think? James, Ethan, ready to share your insights?
James: Sophia, gotcha. Here’s my slice:

- **East Point Mall** is tight, minus the size issue. Checks most boxes, esp. for students and stuff. Over budget but jamming.
  
- **Starlight Valley** missing on students and employee vibes. Just parking and trash? Meh.

- **Cape James Beach**? Tourists=yes, but parking and waste are downers. Still, got some good points.

Ranking:
1. **East Point Mall** - even with the size and cost, it’s where the crowd's at.
2. **Cape James Beach** - mixed bag, but tourists and low comp are sweet.
3. **Starlight Valley** - not feeling it, few pluses but lots of minuses.

Ethan, thoughts? Or anyone else jumping in?
James: Sophia, Ethan, looking sharp! Here's my quick take:

- **East Point Mall**: Spot on! Loads of parking, folks buzzing around, tons of students, easy trash handling, plenty of potential staff. Just a bit snug on space.

- **Starlight Valley**: Got parking and easy waste management but lacking pretty much everywhere else, especially in student and workforce vibes.

- **Cape James Beach**: Killer spot for tourists and beating out competitors. Parking and trash handling are sore points, though. Workforce is solid.

My ranks?
1. **East Point Mall** - Hits almost all the right notes. Size can be worked around.
2. **Cape James Beach** - Unique but has its challenges. Worth the hustle.
3. **Starlight Valley** - Just not cutting it for what we need.

Ethan, what’s your angle? Or anyone else tuning in, chime in!
Ethan: Sophia, James, you're missing key points. East Point Mall isn't just about the crowd; it's also a logistical nightmare! High maintenance costs ignored? Not smart.

Starlight Valley, seriously? Low buying cost but no workforce or students. Great, we buy cheap, and then what? Sit on our hands?

And Cape James Beach. Parking and waste disposal are critical, Sophia. You think tourists will flock to a place with trash problems?

Re-rank:
1. **East Point Mall** - Despite its costs, it has crucial advantages.
2. **Cape James Beach** - Tourist spot, yes, but issues are deal-breakers.
3. **Starlight Valley** - It's like setting cash on fire.

Real talk, folks. Let's not sugarcoat this.
Ethan: Wait, got my wires crossed. Here’s the real deal:

**East Point Mall**: Everyone’s gaga over this, but high maintenance? Not a peep from you lot. Best foot traffic and workforce but at what cost? Sophia, overlooked much?

**Starlight Valley**: James, buddy, parking and low cost won’t staff our kitchen. No workforce, no students. Dead on arrival.

**Cape James Beach**: Sophia and James, you’re high if you think tourists trump no parking or waste issues. But, low maintenance and heavy tourist footfall? Might bring in the dough.

So, let’s cut the fluff.
1. **Cape James Beach** - High tourist traffic, low upkeep. Parking? We’ll figure it out.
2. **East Point Mall** - Costs a fortune, but the crowd’s there.
3. **Starlight Valley** - Why bother? Save the cash.

There, fixed it for you. Can we get real now, or are we playing fantasy restaurant?
