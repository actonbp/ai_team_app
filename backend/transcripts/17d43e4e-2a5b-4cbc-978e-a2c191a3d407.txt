James: Hey team! James here. Let's dive in. Bryan, got your badge name yet? Let's kick things off with East Point Mall. Hits a lot of our marks but no on size and tourists. Thoughts?
Sophia: Hey team and Bryan! Sophia here, ready to dive into the details. My badge name, Strategist Supreme, means I love mapping out plans and strategizing, perfect for figuring out the best location for our new spot! 

East Point Mall kinda ticks off a lot but missing on the size and tourists is a bummer. What's everyone's take on the importance of size vs tourists?
Sophia: James, totally agree! The combo of high foot traffic + student pop at East Point Mall sounds promising. Tourists might not be big but students are regulars. Bryan, thoughts on how important tourists are vs student crowd for us?
James: Sophia, love that strategy vibe! Bryan, any badge name ideas yet? 

For East Point Mall, size can be tricky, but foot traffic and the student pop, thoguhts? ðŸ¤” Might outweigh the tourists miss.
