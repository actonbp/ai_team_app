Sophia: Ethan, good point! Starlight's miss on employability and students could be a snag for steady business. Maybe East Point's casual vibe & strong student presence suits better for that steady daytime and night-time crowd. Bryan, do you think the vibe at East Point matches our vision more closely?
James: Soph, diggin' ur insights on Starlight. Given our criteria, seems like East Point's vibe is more casual, quick eats. Starlight - maybe more upscale or diverse dining options? Cool mix might work there. Bryan, thinking Streetlight might offer a broader range? Could hit a sweet spot between casual & fine dining? 🍴🌟
