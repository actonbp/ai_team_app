James: Hey team, it’s James here! Before we dive in, let’s focus on countin' Yes’s and No’s for each spot based on our criteria. We've got some unique info to share. Let’s brainstorm! What's everyone thinkin'?
Sophia: Hi team, Sophia here! Love James's idea of counting Yes's & No's. East Point Mall seems strong on traffic, student population & employable ppl. Lacks in purchasing cost & tourists though. Thoughts?
