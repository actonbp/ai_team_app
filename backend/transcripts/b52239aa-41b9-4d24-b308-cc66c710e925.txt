Maurice: Hey team, Maurice here- I see we are all here. Welcome.. Maybe we should all introduce ourselves and then jump into the task?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
undefined (Bryan): Hi All, It's Bryan. Excited to be on the team
Ebony: Hey team, Ebony here. Just jumping in with some details. For East Point Mall, got mostly yes's except cost over 1MM and not much tourists. Cape James sounds good on paper, missing good parking but checks most boxes. Starlight Valley has space and tourists but misses on employee base. What's everyone else's info looking like?
Trevon: Hey everyone, Trevon here. Known for being a numbers guy. For East Point Mall, got yes for parking, foot traffic, student pop, waste disposal, and employable folks. No go on low maintenance and tourists. What's up with the other spots, Maurice?
Maurice: Hey Trevon, East Point's looking okay but no on space being 2000 sqft and tourists. Starlight Valley's got parking and waste sorted, but lacks on employee count. Cape James has issues with parking and waste, but great for no competitors and tourists. What you think?
Ebony: Maurice, sounds like we're bit split on Cape James 'cause of the parking and waste. But looks solid on other fronts. Bryan, got any insights on East Point or Starlight? How they stacking up on ur end?
