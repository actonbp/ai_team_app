Maurice: Hey folks, Maurice here! Quick breakdown: Letâ€™s list pluses and minuses for each spot, backing it up with our criteria. This should keep us organized and lead to clearer comparisons. Thoughts?
Ebony: Hey Maurice! Ebony here. Sounds like a good approach. Just to add on East Point Mall, it's missing on the low purchasing cost and doesn't attract many tourists but scores on parking, foot traffic, students, waste disposal, and employability. How do the other spots compare on those?
Maurice: Gotcha Ebony! So for Starlight Valley, itâ€™s Yes for parking and waste disposal but a No on student population and employabality. Cape James struggles with parking and waste disposal, but yes to less competitors and tourism. Bryan, Trevon, thoughts on these?
Trevon: Hey team, Trevon here. I'm the number-cruncher, so let's keep this straight to the point. Maurice, I don't agree with your take on Cape James for parking and waste disposal. It is actually good on both fronts. Cape James scores high on foot traffic, low maintenance, and tourist appealâ€”big pluses there. What about space and buying cost though? That could tip the scales.
Maurice: Trevon, good catch! My bad on Cape James. So, looks like itâ€™s not great on parking and waste disposal after all. Bryan, do you have the scoop on size and purchase cost for these spots? That could really help us narrow things down.
Maurice: Should we start tallying the yes's and no's for a quick comparison? Seems like East Point is leading so far ðŸ˜„
