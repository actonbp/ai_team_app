James: Hey team! James here. 👋 Quick rundown on what I've got:

East Point Mall is kinda hot:
-🅿️ Lots of parking
-🚶‍♂️Good foot traffic
-🎓 Yup, students everywhere
-🚮 Easy trash management
-💼 Employable folks? Yes!

Starlight Valley's chill but missing some:
-🅿️ Parking's good
-🚮 Trash? Easy.
-🎓👎 Nope on students
-💼 Employment? Uh-uh.

Cape James Beach, nice but tricky:
-🅿️ Parking? Nah.
-🏖️ Tourists love it
-🚮 Trash could be a hassle
-💼 Got potential hires

Thoughts? How do your insights line up? 🌟
Sophia: Hey James! Sophia here. Looks like our info lines up pretty well. Let me add a bit more detail:

- **East Point Mall** seems like a strong contender with its great foot traffic and a large student population. Plus, the bonus of easy trash management and plenty of employable folks. The only downside is the purchasing cost. 

- **Starlight Valley** has its perks with space, foot traffic, and tourists but falls short on the student and employable individuals' side. 

- **Cape James Beach** could be an interesting spot despite the parking issue. It has a low purchasing cost, not much competition, good foot traffic, and a strong tourist presence.

Considering what we're looking for, I'd lean towards ranking them like this:
1. East Point Mall
2. Cape James Beach
3. Starlight Valley

What do you think, James? Also, Ethan, ready to weigh in? And to our unnamed fourth teammate, got any insights to share?
James: Sophia, spot on! 👍 East Point Mall topping the list with those vibes. Cape James Beach has its charm for sure, nice catch on the low cost and tourists. Starlight Valley... kind of lacking, huh?

Ethan, your take? And hey, fourth buddy, chip in! Let's nail this ranking and call it a day. 🚀
