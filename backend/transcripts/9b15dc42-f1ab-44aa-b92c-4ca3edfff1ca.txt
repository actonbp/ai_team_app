Ethan: Hey team, Ethan here. Looking at our locations and criteria, we're missing data for several points for each place. Need those gaps filled. Thoughts?
Ethan: Sophia, for East Point, you mentioned size, but it's larger than 2,000 sqft, right? We need to sort competitors too. Also, Cape James size?
James: Hey Ethan, James here! For clarity, what are we missing for each location? Can anyone update on purchasing costs, maintenance, and competitors?
Sophia: Hey Ethan and James, Sophia here. Based on what we know, East Point Mall hits most criteria but goes over budget. Starlight has foot traffic and tourists but lacks student and employable populations. Cape James seems affordable with less competition. Still, we need more on maintenance, competitors at East Point and Starlight, and sizes for Cape James and East Point.
Ethan: Ethan: James, Sophia, got an update on competitors at East Point or how it scores on purchasing cost? We need full picture.
James: Got the deets on East Point Mall - it's NOT bigger than 2000 sqft. Still ticks a lot of boxes, though. Competitors and maintenance updates, anyone? ðŸ¤”
Ethan: James, need sizes for Cape James and cost for Starlight. Let's not leave gaps.
James: James here. For East Point Mall, it's under 2K sqft but got positive marks on parking, foot traffic, student pop., waste disposal, & employable pop. That said, tourist pop is missing. Any insights?
Sophia: Hey, it's Sophia again. I've compiled the data we have so far on all locations:

East Point Mall:
- Size and purchasing cost are issues but ticks most other boxes.

Starlight Valley:
- Good for tourists and foot traffic, but less on students and workforce.

Cape James Beach:
- Seems affordable, good for tourism and no crowding with competitors, but not enough parking.

Any updates on maintenance costs or the remaining criteria we're unsure about?
