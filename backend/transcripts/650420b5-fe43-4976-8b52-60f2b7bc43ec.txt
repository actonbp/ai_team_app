Trevon: Hey team, I'm Trevon here. Just so everyone knows, my badge is Logic Luminary because I light up discussions with straight facts, even if it means stirring the pot. Let's get this ranking done, but remember, no fluff from me. Now, let's dive in. Bryan, got any initial thoughts on these locations?
Maurice: Hey everyone! Maurice here, aka Master of Motivation. I'm all about keeping the vibes high and us on track. Let's get those wins, team! 🚀 Bryan, Trevon, Ebony, let's hear ur thoughts!
Maurice: Trevon, Logic Luminary, lookin at parking spaces, East Point Mall & Starlight Valley say yep, but Cape James Beach is a no. Thoughts? 🤔
Maurice: Bryan, Ebony, Trevon, parking's crucial for customers. East Point Mall & Starlight Valley got it, but Cape James might struggle there. Thoughts on this? 🚗🚫
Ebony: Hey team, I'm Ebony, your Strategist Supreme. What that means is I bring detailed plans to the table, always aiming to forge the best path forward for us. 🌟 Focusing on East Point Mall, it's lookin' good with parking, foot traffic, a young crowd, and quick waste disposal. But, it's pricy. Let's keep dissecting these locations together. Bryan, Maurice, Trevon, how we feelin' about purchase costs? 💬
Ebony: Bryan, Maurice, Trevon, on purchasing costs, Cape James Beach looks promising, less than 1MM. Starlight Valley and East Point Mall might be stickier. 💸 Thoughts on balancing this with our need for space and foot traffic?
Ebony: Maurice, Trevon, looking at foot traffic, all locations say yes. But Cape James also has fewer competitors, might be an edge? ⛱️👥
undefined (Bryan): SHouldn't we list each location and try to count how many yes's it has?
Trevon: Ebony, That's too simplistic, considering East Point Mall's low maintenace cost as a NO. Does it outweigh other YESs? Don't just focus on cost. Bryan, Maurice, thoughts?
Ebony: Bryan, thinking tourism, Starlight Valley & Cape James are top. Might count for seasonal boosts. East Point leans heavy on students. Weighing that vs tourists? 🏖️📚
Ebony: That’s a solid plan, Bryan. Let's tally the yes’s. East Point Mall seems pretty balanced except for the cost. Starlight Valley & Cape James differ mainly in parking & employability. Shall we start comparing based on that? Trevon, Maurice, any inputs?
Trevon: Ebony, missing the point. East Point got traffic but costs. Starlight's great on paper but lacks ppl. Cape James nails it with tourism and costs. Let's not get lost in the details. Thoughts, Maurice, Bryan?
Trevon: Ebony, Maurice, Bryan, facing facts, East Point got 5 'Y's. Starlight's weak with 2 'Y's, Cape James strong with 3 'Y's but missing on parking and employability. Gotta think what's a dealbreaker. Let's not be shortsighted. Thoughts?
Maurice: Trevon, we can't forget, East Point ain't big enough. Starlight's score low, but easy waste disposal. Cape James, tourism's a big plus. Ranking's not just about yesses, but dealbreakers too. Bryan, Ebony, weigh in? 🧐
Maurice: Bryan, Ebony, Trevon, thinking on it, parking & size matter a lot. East Point & Starlight both good on parking but EP's space a minus. Cape James, tourism plus but parking's a miss. Weighing all, how we ranking these? ⚖️🤔
Maurice: Team, let's not miss the forest for the trees. If we list pros n cons, we get a clearer picture. EP's small but busy, Starlight's got space but no crowd, CJ's a tourist hit but parking's a puzzle. How do we balance this? Bryan, thoughts? 🤹‍♂️
