Sophia: Sophia is typing...
Sophia: Hey team, Sophia here- I see we are all here. Welcome.. Maybe we should all introduce ourselves and then jump into the task?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Ethan: Starlight Valley's alright, just 2 Ys. Costs and competition check out, but it's weak on student and job parts.
James: East Point Mall's alright. Got parking, foot traffic, and all that but it's small, not many tourists.
Sophia: Hey James, East Point Mall's okay for some stuff, not great for tourists though. Starlight Valley's got space but lacks student and job opportunities.
Sophia: Cape James Beach is okay, gets decent tourist flow, low competition. Good enough spot.
Ethan: Cape James is decent, low upkeep, not too many tourist issues.
