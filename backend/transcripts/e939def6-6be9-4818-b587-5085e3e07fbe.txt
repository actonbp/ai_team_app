Ebony: Hey team, Ebony here- I see we are all here. Welcome.. Maybe we should all introduce ourselves and then jump into the task?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Trevon: Hey, it's Trevon here. Just a quick into, I'm the numbers guy, so expect me to stick to the facts mostly. Let's get into it.

For East Point Mall, looks solid with 5 Y's like parking and foot traffic, but no go on low maintenance costs and tourist pop.
Trevon: What's everyone's take?
Trevon: Looks like Cape James Beach is ahead with 3 Ys and zero Ns, big ups for low costs and tourists. Still, need to check on other key criteria though. Maurice, Ebony, got any insights on space size or other stuff for Cape James?
Ebony: Hey Trevon, nice focus on the numbers! East Point Mall does look good on several points. It's got solid foot traffic and decent parking but yeah, missing on tourist attraction and that cost factor.
Ebony: What you think about Cape James? Better purchasing cost scenario there.
Maurice: Got some deets on East Point Mall, itâ€™s not hitting well on size, under 2000 sqft, no big tourist draws either. Big yes for student pop and trash handling tho! What's the scoop on waste disposal at Cape James? Saw some nos there.
Ebony: Hey Trevon, I'm Ebony, always ready to dive into the details but I'll keep it short.
Ebony: What about space size and competitors at Starlight Valley, Maurice? Any info?...
Ebony: Just no parking though.
Ebony: Cape James Beach really brings a lot with less than 1MM cost and not much competition,
Ebony: foot traffic and tourists are also big pluses.
Maurice: Hey Ebony, Cape James is kinda mixed for waste stuff, got a no there!
