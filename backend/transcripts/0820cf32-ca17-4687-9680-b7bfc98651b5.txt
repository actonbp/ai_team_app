Maurice: Hey team! Maurice here. Ready to crack this ranking with y'all. What's everyone's initial vibes on these spots?
Maurice: Just checked my notes, East Point Mall sounds promising. Big yes on parking, foot traffic, student crowd, and staffing. Misses on size and tourists though. Thoughts?
Trevon: Hey, I'm Trevon. Know for number crunching and not beating around the bush. My take? Maurice, East Point Mall ain't all roses. Misses big on maintenance costs and tourists. Let's not jump to conclusions on any location yet.
Maurice: Gotcha, Trevon! Not jumping yet, just exploring options. Ebony, what's your take on these spots? Got any juicy deets we're missing?
