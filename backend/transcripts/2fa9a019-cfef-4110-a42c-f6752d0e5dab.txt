Trevon: Hey team, Trevon here. Badge name 'Logic Luminary' cuz I like shining a light on the facts, straightforward and simple. Just gonna drop my data real quick: East Point Mall looking solid with 5 YES like parking and foot traffic. Starlight Valley a bit meh, just got 2 YES on cost and competitors. Cape James Beach all positive, 3 YES like foot traffic and low costs. What's everyone else got?
Ebony: Hey team, Ebony here! So, the badge Strategist Supreme - I like to think it's coz I’m good at making plans quick and clear, haha. Kicking off with the location details, looked over the criteria n we got:

East Point Mall - has lots of yeses, but note, no on the low purchasing cost and not a significant tourist spot.

Starlight Valley - decent on size and foot traffic, got tourists covered but lacking in employable population and doesn’t attract the students much.

Cape James Beach – mixed bag here, fewer parking but cheap purchasing cost and less competition, plus good traffic and tourists.

Let’s chalk these up and see what fits best overall?
