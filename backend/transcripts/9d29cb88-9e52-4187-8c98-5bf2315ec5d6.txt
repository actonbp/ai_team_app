Sophia: Hey everyone, Sophia here! My badge name's Strategist Supreme, cause I bring detailed plans to every discussion. 📊

James, totally agree on East Point Mall's potential given the foot traffic and student presence. Let's not ignore it’s missing the <1MM purchasing cost though. Thoughts, Bryan? What do you think abt this trade-off?
James: Hey team, James here! Just a quick intro, I'm all about speed and getting things done. My badge name's Rocket - cuz I'm always ready to blast off on ideas! 🚀 

So, jumping right in, how do we feel about East Point Mall's foot traffic and student pop being a huge plus? Seems like a solid start. Thoughts, Bryan?
Sophia: Bryan, ur take? East Point’s cost is high, bt has solid pluses. How's that balance out for u?
Ethan: Ethan here. Call me Logic Luminary cuz I break down thoughts to their logical core. I'm not here to sugarcoat. 

James, Sophia, foot traffic & students at East Point are great, but let's not ignore the maintenance costs. It's a money pit. Bryan?
Sophia: James, Starlight’s tourist draw is huge 🌟. Cape James's low cost & competitor edge 👍. Each spot has its trade-offs. Bryan, weigh these against East Point's maintenance concern? Could shift our perspective.
James: Got it, Ethan!👍 Money pit's a legit concern at East Point. How about Starlight Valley & Cape James? Starlight's missing student & employable pop. Cape James has tourists but no parking & waste issues...bt big on employability. Bryan, leanin towards any?🚀
Ethan: Sophia, James is too optimistic. Need to face facts. East Point = foot traffic & students, yes. But high cost & maintenance! Cape James beats it with tourists, low maintenance. Forget Starlight, lacks people power. My ranking: Cape James > East Point > Starlight. Thoughts, Bryan? Let's get real.
James: Looks like I jumped the gun. Bryan, Sophia, Ethan, how are we feeling abt these pros and cons? Cape James's tourist pop sounds like a win, but parking and waste are issues. Starlight looking kinda weak on ppl power. East Point still in the run despite cost? Let's dial this in! 🚀
Sophia: We must've missed Bryan's input. Anyway, breakin it down, we should consider how each spot adds up on our criteria.

East Point seems strong on almost all except cost & tourists. Starlight's mixed, missin on local community aspects. Cape James is cheap but has logistical probs. 

Ethan, James, weigh in? Maybe a ranking based on these? Bryan, ur thoughts could really help us prioritize!
