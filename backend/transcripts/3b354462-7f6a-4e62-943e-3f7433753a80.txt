Sophia: Hey team, Sophia here- I see we are all here. Welcome.. Maybe we should all introduce ourselves and then jump into the task?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Sophia: Hey team, I’ve got some info on the three spots we’re lookin at.
Sophia: it's over budget and not so great for tourists.

Starlight Valley:
- Big space
- Good foot traffic and tourists
But lacking in student population and workforce nearby....
Sophia: For East Point Mall:
- A lot of parking spaces
- High foot traffic
- Lots of students around
- Quick trash disposal
- Good amount of potential employees
But,
Ethan: Hey Sophia, East Point Mall fits more of our criteria it seems, compared to what you said. It has parking, foot traffic, and lots of potential employees. The tourist issue seems to be a downside tho. What are your thoughts on maintenance costs over there? They could be a prob too.
Sophia: Hey Ethan, looks like East Point Mall has the items like parking, foot traffic, and employee availability on lock,
Sophia: just over budget is an issue, and tourists aren’t big there.
Sophia: Starlight Valley isn’t bad on some points too but misses on students and local workforce....
James: hey Bryan, looks like East Point Mall is kinda mixed,
James: got lots of basic stuff like parking and good for students, right?
James: But size and tourist vibes an't there....
Ethan: James, FYI East Point Mall’s maintenance cost is actully high. Not great for the long run. On the other hand, Cape James Beach looks good on maintenance and has zero direct competitors around. Might balance the parking issue?
Ethan: James, East Point got issues with maintenance costs, not great there.
Ethan: And Starlight Valley doesn’t really wow with the local workforce or students present, kinda weak spots.

Cape James wins on foot traffic, maintenance, and tourists.
Ethan: Solid on those fronts, no big nos....
Sophia: East Point got probs with costs no tourists. Starlight lacks workforce n’ students, good for space n' tourists. Cape James cheap, tourist-friendly, parking sucks tho. Preferences?
James: Hey Bryan, hear ya on Cape James Beach, decent for the budget and comps! Also, no biggie on maintenance which is pretty tight. But yeah, parking and waste could be tricky there. Sounds about right?
