Trevon: Hey team, I'm Trevon. The numbers guy with not much patience for lengthy chats. Let's keep it brief and to the point. Let's not focus too much on one location. I'll be sharing yes/no for each spot as we go. Ebony, Maurice, Bryan, got any starting thoughts?
Trevon: Ebony, Maurice, thoughts? We can't just hang back. Need to start tossing around these yes/nos.
Trevon: Ebony, Maurice, no thoughts? Bryan, any insights on these locations? We need to weigh in on Yes/No for key features. I‚Äôll start - East Point Mall seems strong on foot traffic and has a solid student demographic. But maintenance costs‚Äînope. Too high. Thoughts?
Ebony: Hey, I'm Ebony! Badge name's coz I'm good at laying out plans in detail. Trevon, on East Point Mall, agree on the student demo and foot traffic! Plus, got a Y on parking spaces and employable population, but it's a N for purchase cost under 1MM. Maintenance might be an issue, huh?
Maurice: Hey, Maurice here! üëã Let's dive in. East Point Mall - got good news: Y for parking, student pop, foot traffic, waste disposal, and employable folks. Downside it's a N for size over 2000 sqft and tourist pop. Thougts? Bryan, got input on this?
Maurice: Bryan, thoughts on Cape James? Got Y for low competitors and tourist pop. But N for parking and waste disposal. Might be tricky for operations. ü§î
Trevon: Bryan, Maurice's take on Cape James doesn't align with my info. Cape James has a Y for substantial foot traffic, low maintenance, and large tourist pop. No mention of competitors or waste disposal from my end. Seems like we need to clear up some mixed signals here.
Trevon: Maurice, your info's off. Cape James has plus points on foot traffic, low maintenance, and tourists. No word on parking or waste from me. Let's keep facts straight yea? Bryan, where do you stand on these? We need all the right details to make a solid pick.
Trevon: Maurice, your mixing things up. Cape James does better in terms of foot traffic, maintenance, and tourists. Let's not mess this up with wrong info. Bryan, Ebony, Maurice, we gotta get our facts straight. What's the deal with Starlight Valley? Anybody got the lowdown on that?
Maurice: Trevon, Starlight Valley's cool on parking and waste disposal, but it's a no-go for large student pop and employable peeps. Looks like mixed bag there ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Bryan, Ebony, this help narrow it down some?
Trevon: Bryan, Ebony, Maurice, got it twisted. Starlight Valley is Y for cost <1MM and few competitors. But a big N for student pop and employable folks. Given what we know, where does each place stand? I'm thinking East Point and Cape James got more going for them than Starlight. Agree?
Trevon: Ebony, Maurice, Bryan, u guys seeing a pattern? East Point & Cape James outshine Starlight. Let‚Äôs focus. Starlight's lacking big time on student pop and employable folks. Not ideal, right? East Point and Cape James have their perks but differ. Which one‚Äôs leading for u all?
Trevon: Ebony, Maurice, Bryan, let's not forget the big picture here. East Point and Cape James have their strong points, but we're not just tallying positives. We need a ranked list considering all our criteria. Before we jump to conclusions, let's ensure we're seeing the full scope. How about a recap and rank our spots considering the pros and cons we've discussed?
