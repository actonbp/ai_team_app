Ebony: Hi Maurice, Trevon, and Bryan, Ebony here. Just looking over the details for each spot, East Point Mall seems solid with good foot traffic, student population, and job market. Only downsides—no cheap purchasing cost and not much for tourists. What you guys think?
Ebony: East Point Mall, good foot traffic + student pop, pricey, not for tourists. Cape James cheaper, got tourists + traffic. Thoughts?
Trevon: Hey guys, Trevon here. Just going over my notes:

- **East Point Mall**: Good parking, foot traffic, student pop, waste disposal, employables (5Y, 2N).
- **Starlight Valley**: Cheap, few competitors (2Y, 2N).
- **Cape James Beach**: Good traffic, low costs, tourists (3Y, 0N).

Let’s keep track of the yeses and no’s for each place. What else we got?
Maurice: Sup guys, Maurice here. East Point Mall got 5Y, 2N: parking, foot traffic, students, waste, employables but no big space or tourists. 

Starlight Valley 2Y, 2N: parking, waste, but no students or employable ppl. 

Cape James Beach 3Y, 3N: tourists, few competitors, employables but no parking, students, or waste access.
