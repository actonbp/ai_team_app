Trevon: Hey team, Trevon here. Logic Luminary 'cause I shine a light on clear, logical choices, even if it means stirring the pot. Let’s dive in.

East Point Mall sounds decent with parking & foot traffic, but those maintenance costs are a no-go. Starlight Valley’s missing a workforce and student crowd, pretty concerning. Cape James though, ticks most boxes - foot traffic, low costs, tourists. Thoughts?
Trevon: Maurice, Ebony, Bryan, Cape James looks solid for touritsts and foot traffic. But wht abt workforce? Only mall scores well there. Thoughts on balancing this?
