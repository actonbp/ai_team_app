Maurice: Hey team! Maurice here, aka Master of Motivation. All about keeping the vibes positive and pushing us towards the goal. Let's get this ranking sorted!
Maurice: Got all the deets on our spots, folks! Ready when you are to dive into the specifics. Let's make this decision a breeze! ðŸ’¨ #TeamworkMakesTheDreamWork
Trevon: Hey, I'm Trevon, badge name Logic Luminary, cuz I'm all about the numbers and logic. Let's cut the fluff and get straight to it. Cape James sounds good but misses on student pop and employee pool. Big NO from me. Who's really thinking tourist flow is gonna cover us year-round? Bryan, Maurice, thoughts?
Trevon: Ebony, haven't heard ur take yet. East Point has traffic and parking, but those maintenance costs are a headache. Worth it?
Trevon: Maurice, East Point's got foot traffic & parking, but no tourists. Honestly, sounds like a mixed bag tbh. Starlight Valley's got no ppl problem but no ppl either. Thoughts? #KeepIt100
Trevon: Bryan, we're ignoring the elephant in the room. Starlightâ€™s cheap but it's practically a ghost town for a workforce. Why even consider it? #FactsOnly
Trevon: Maurice, Ebony, got to say, Cape James ticks most boxes except students & workforce. Big gamble on seasonal tourists. Too risky or worth the shot?
Trevon: Missed the maintenance costs on Cape James, actually low. So, minus on student & workforce, but high on almost all else. Maybe I'm too harsh. Bryan, rethinking this?
Ebony: Hey everyone! I'm Ebony, also known as Strategist Supreme. I'm all about the big picture and connecting the dots to form a detailed plan. Let's dive into these locations and see how they stack up. Given what Trevon and others have shared, let's not forget to weigh all our criterias evenly. What are we thinking now?
Ebony: Trevon, looking at it all, East Point might be our best shot. Lots of yes's minus the tourist bit but hits most criteria. Cape James lacks in some crucial areas (parking, students, staff). Thoughts? #BalanceIsKey
