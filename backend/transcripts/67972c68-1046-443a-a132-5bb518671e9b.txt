undefined (Bryan): Hello, shouldn't our strategy be to list how many yes's each location has?
Ethan: Ethan here. Got a question - Bryan, how do we even consider Starlight Valley with only 2 Ys that matter? Competitors, really? Need to focus on $$$ and foot traffic!
Sophia: Great point, Bryan! Let's break it down with those "yes's" then. Based on what we know:

East Point Mall:
- Y: 5
- N: 2
Missing info on maintenance and competitors.

Starlight Valley:
- Y: 3 
- N: 2
Missing info on parking, purchasing cost, maintenance, competitors, waste disposal.

Cape James Beach:
- Y: 4
- N: 1
Missing info on size, maintenance, student population, waste disposal, employable population.

Any toughts on filling the gaps?
Ethan: So, no maintenance info on Valley and competitors around the Mall, Sophia? Seems like we're missing pieces. Bryan, got any insights on this?
James: James is typing...
