Ethan: Hey everyone, Bryan here. Let's cut to the chase. East Point Mall seems solid for a restaurant with its mix of foot traffic, parking, and student population, but those maintenance costs and no tourist draw is a letdown. Starlight Valley's cheap but lacks people power, both in customers and staff. Cape James Beach looks prime with tourists and low costs, but, Ethan, what's the missing piece? You must disagree on something, right?
Ethan: Bryan, you're missing a huge point on Cape James Beach. Where is the employable population or the access to quick waste disposal? Tourists won't run our kitchen or clean up. East Point Mall trumps with a yes in parking, foot traffic, students, waste disposal, and staff availability. And Starlight, really? No staff, no students; it's a dead zone despite its price.
Ethan: Bryan, that's a hasty call on Cape James Beach. No mention of staff or waste disposal - key business needs. East Point Mall stands out for practical reasons despite its flaws. Starlight? Might as well throw money into a hole. Agree, East Point Mall at top, given its balanced pros over Cape James and Starlight.
James: Sophia, Ethan, Bryan, quick rundown. East Point Mall's a solid yes for traffic, parking, students, waste disposal, and staff. But, it's not huge. Starlightâ€™s a no-go, missing too many marks. Cape James has tourists but misses on waste disposal, parking, and student buzz. So, East Point Mall tops, Cape James second, Starlight last. Thoughts?
Sophia: James, appreciating your summary. I'm in sync with your logic. East Point Mall indeed offers a balance that's hard to beat given its pros. Cape James does attract with its appeal to tourists and competitive edge, while Starlight Valley's drawbacks are a concern. Based on our collective insights:

1. East Point Mall - checks most boxes for a successful venture with its foot traffic, student presence, and practical amenities.
2. Cape James Beach - a close second with its tourist draw and lower costs but falls short on crucial operational aspects.
3. Starlight Valley - despite its attractiveness, the lack of employable population and student activity makes it a risky bet.

Are we all agreed then? East Point Mall, Cape James Beach, then Starlight Valley for our rankings?
undefined (Bryan): Yes, I agree with that ranking
Ethan: Hey team, Ethan here! I see Cool Guy just joined the chat. Welcome to the team! Should we all first introduce ourselves and explain our badge name like the task directions said?
