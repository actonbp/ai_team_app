Ebony: Hey team, Ebony here, a.k.a Strategist Supreme. Just means I'm all about laying down detailed plans and strategies. Excited to work with you all on ranking these locations! Now, let's dive into these locaiton details. How's everyone leaning so far?
Ebony: Based on what i see, East Point Mall hits a lot of our criteria except for purchasing cost nd tourism. Could be a strong contender for us. Thoughts?
Ebony: Def see where ur coming from Maurice. East Point Mall looks solid on many fronts but that purchasing cost is a biggie. How do we feel about the lack of tourism there? Could be a downside for us.
Maurice: Hey team, Maurice here, a.k.a Master of Motivation! üåü All about keeping the vibe high and the team on track. Let's nail this! Agree with Strategist Supreme, EPM's lookin' good, but not perfect. üöÄ Bryan, thoughts?
Ebony: True, the tourism factor at EPM is a bit of a miss. But, it's strong in other areas like foot traffic and employable pop. Maybe Cape James for tourism draw? It hits that mark and has less comp too. What do ya'll think? #balancingact
Ebony: So if we're talkin strategy, maybe think about how many "yes" boxes each location ticks off for us. Like EPM has a lot of yes's but misses on cost and tourists. Can we overlook those for the other benefits? #strategytalk
Trevon: Hey, Trevon here, badge's Logic Luminary - basically, I'm all bout numbers and cuttin through the fluff. Gonna be real, I think ya'll overvaluing EPM due to its misses. Cape James and even Starlight got their strengths we're ignoring. Let's not get tunnel vision on EPM. #realtalk
Maurice: Cape James looks tempting for tourism but lacks in parking & waste disposal. Might be tricky. Starlight Valley seems to miss a few marks, especially on employable pop. Kinda makes EPM look even better, despite its flaws. Thoughts?
Ebony: Got it, let's tally up. EPM has strong points except purch cost and tourism. Cape James shines in tourism, cost, less comp but lacks parking & waste disposal. Starlight hits big with space, foot traffic, tourists but falls short on employable ppl and students. Compare that? #overview
Maurice: Logic Luminary, good point! Gotta weigh all sides. Maybe we list the yes's and no's for each spot and compare? See where we stand. #strategy #teamwork Let's not miss the forest for the trees! üå≥ Bryan, Ebony, inputs?
Ebony: Bryan, Maurice, Trevon, let's recap: EPM has pros except for cost & tourists. Cape James nails tourism & cost, but parking & disposal are issues. Starlight's good on space, traffic & tourists, but lacks employable pop & students. Which gaps are we more okay with? #decisions
Ebony: Agree, Maurice. Parking & waste are big. Plus, EPM's strong on employability & foot traffic. Gives it an edge? Starlight's good too but the student and employable pop. might be tricky. Feels like we're leanin towards EPM, with Starlight & Cape James fighting for 2nd. Thoughts? #weighingoptions
Maurice: Considering that, feels like each has its ups and downs. Maybe we prioritize what's hardest to change? Parking and waste disposal are tough fixes. That makes EPM and Starlight more appealing maybe? ü§î Ebony, Logic Luminary, thoughts? #priorities
Ebony: Maurice, talling up, leaning EPM cuz parking & waste disposal seem key. Starlight's missing on employable pop., tricky to fix. Despite EPM's cost & tourist issues, benefits might outweigh. How bout EPM 1st, then Starlight & Cape James? #Compromise ü§ù What do ya say? üåü
Ebony: I'm in for EPM 1st for the reasons we've discussed. Starlight as 2nd, its space and foot traffic are pluses. Cape James 3rd, tourism great but parking & disposal big concerns. How's that sound for everyone? #FinalThoughts ü§î Bryan, Maurice, Trevon?
Ebony: Agreed, Maurice! I'm good with EPM 1st, Starlight 2nd, Cape James 3rd. Benefits & challenges considered, it's a solid lineup. If we're all on board, looks like we've got our ranking! üåü #AgreementReady Bryan, Trevon, confirm? ü§ù
Maurice: Sounds solid to me! EPM takes top for tight reasons. Starlight Valley nabs 2nd with its perks, and Cape James lands 3rd coz of those key issues. We all in agreement here? üöÄ #TeamSync Let's lock this down! ü§ù Bryan, Trevon, Ebony?
