Ebony: Hey team, Ebony here! I see cool guy just joined the chat. Welcome to the team! Should we all first introduce ourselves and explain our badge name like the task directions said?
Ebony: Hey team, Ebony here! My badge name, "Strategist Supreme," is all about crafting winning strategies. Weâ€™ve got three locations to consider!

East Point Mall looks strong on several fronts, meeting 5 of our requirements incl. foot traffic and employment pool, but misses on purchase cost and tourist presence.

Starlight Valley ticks boxes for size, foot traffic, and tourists, but falls short on student and employment opportunities.

Cape James Beach does well on cost, competition, foot traffic, and tourism, lacking only in parking.

Looking forward to hearing your insights too!
