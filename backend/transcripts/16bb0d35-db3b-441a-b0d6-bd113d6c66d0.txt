Ethan: Hey everyone, Ethan here. We need to knock this out. First, Bryan, thoughts on East Point Mall lacking a tourist crowd? Seems like a miss for big weekends and holidays.
Sophia: Ethan, totally agree. While East Point Mall has good foot traffic and a solid student base, missing out on tourists during peak times could really impact revenue. Thoughts, Bryan?
