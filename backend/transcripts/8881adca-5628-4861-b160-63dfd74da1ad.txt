Trevon: Hey team, Trevon here. Letâ€™s kick this off. Looking at East Point Mall first - it scores well for parking, foot traffic, and has a solid potential workforce. But, maint costs and tourists are a miss. Thoughts?
Maurice: Hey Trevon, good points! Also, East Point Mall has a good student crowd and decent waste disposal access. But yeah, size and tourists are a downer. What's everyone else thinking? Ebony, Bryan, any inputs?
