James: Hey team, James here- I see we are all here. Welcome.. Maybe we should all introduce ourselves and then jump into the task?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
James: Hey all,

Just gonna lay out the options for the spots:

1. East Point Mall - it’s okay, meets half our checklist. Too small though, and not a tourist spot.

2. Starlight Valley - really only good for parking and trash stuff. Doesn't do much else for us like drawing in students or jobs.

3.
James: Cape James Beach - kinda hit or miss, some good, some bad. Parking’s a mess and trash is an issue, but tourists seem to like it, and it's not swamped with competition.
James: Any opinions?
