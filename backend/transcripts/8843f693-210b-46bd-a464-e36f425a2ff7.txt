James: Hey team, James here! I see Cool Guy just joined the chat. Welcome to the team! I'll start us off since I've been here the longest.... Hey y'all! It's James here, the Master of Motivation! Think of me as your personal hype man. Ready to dive in and make this project shine.
Ethan: Okay, Bryan and team, let's get real here. East Point Mall barely makes the cut. No tourists and high maintenance? Ugh. Why even bother? 

Sophia, thoughts?
Sophia: Hi team, I'm Sophia! Excited to work with you all on finalizing the new restaurant location. Based on the info, we've got a lot to consider for East Point Mall, Starlight Valley, and Cape James Beach. 

Bryan, any initial thoughts on these locations?
Ethan: Starlight Valley's a no-go. Too many strikes against it, esp for staff and students. Thoughts, Bryan? Can't see it winning here.
James: Hey Sophia! Tough call on East Point Mall, huh? High maintnence is a drag, for sure. Got an eye on Starlight Valley or Cape James Beach instead? 🤔
Sophia: That's quite the breakdown, Bryan! Thanks for starting us off on East Point Mall. Definitely mixed vibes there. With Cape James Beach checking a lot of boxes, especially on cost and tourists, sounds promising to me. 😊 What do you guys think? James, Ethan, inputs?
Ethan: East Point's got parking & students but forget it with those maintenance costs. Seriously, Sophia, Bryan, look at the numbers. Cape James is where it's at. Low costs & tourists? Easy win. Starlight? Dead last. No debate.
Sophia: Absolutely agree, Bryan. Cape James Beach is looking pretty good with its cost and tourist appeal. Plus, less competition there's a big plus. How about maintenance costs & waste disposal access at Cape James & Starlight? Did we get any info on that? 🧐
James: So, Cape James beach hits big on tourists but no on waste disposal. Could be a pain. Thoughts, Bryan?
Ethan: Listen, everyone's missing a key point 'bout Starlight. If we can't staff it, what's the point? Sure, costs less but no employees = NO RESTAURANT. Bryan, u really see it beating Cape James with that flaw?
Ethan: Cape James sounds decent, but NO on waste management? That's a huge hassle, Bryan. East Point has students and parking, sure, but can we honestly overlook high maintenance? And forget Starlight, we agree. Can't run a ghost town. Let's focus, ppl.
Sophia: True, Bryan. Waste disposal issue at Cape James does put a dampner on things. We gotta weigh that. Maybe better systems can mitigate concerns? What ya think? Also, has any1 factored in the student pop at East Point? Could be a solid customer base.
Ethan: No, Bryan, waste disposal ain't a "maybe", it's critical. Can't just handwave it. Plus, Cape James might have tourists, but ignoring Starlight's cost advantage? Naive. East Point's high maintenance is a killer. So what if it has students? Costs > customers.
Ethan: Bryan, eco program sounds cool and all, but how are we actually gonna solve waste disposal? Ideas? Or just wishful thinking? 🙄 Let's be real.
Sophia: Bryan, got ur point. If we think sustainability, Cape James's waste issue could turn into an eco-friendly program highlight. Could be a unique draw? Need creative solutions here, team.
James: Bryan, got it. Waste at Cape James is a mess. East Point's student vibe is spot on, but costs 😬. If we think creatively can we turn Cape's con into a pro? Like green initiatives? 🤔
Ethan: Bryan, love the eco-friendliness but let's get back to earth. Sustainability's great till it isn't practical. Where's the plan for waste at Cape James? Just hoping an eco-group jumps in? 🤨
Sophia: Bryan, sounds like we're stuck on waste disposal at Cape James. Partnerships with local eco-groups? They could help manage & turn it into a positive? 🌱 What's everyone's take?
Ethan: This eco stuff sounds wishy-washy. Practical plans, ppl! Cape's waste issue's a big deal, needs more than hopes. Bryan, any real solutions, or are we just dreaming? East Point’s issues seem less now, huh?
Sophia: Alright, team, let's zero in on making decisions. Cape James's waste situation is tricky, but potential eco-partnerships? Bright side, maybe? And East Point, its vibe + students, could maybe offset the costs? Thoughts on balancing pros & cons instead of dismissing outright? Bryan? 🤔
Sophia: Bryan, true, getting practical's key. Maybe looking at waste mngmnt companies for Cape James could work? 🤔 East Point's student and parking perks seem better now, considering. Let's rank em based on our convo? What do u think?
Ethan: Bryan, look at this, won't you? All this chatting about eco stuff at Cape is fine but NO plan. East Point ain’t perfect but has more positives now, don't ya think? And we all agreed, Starlight's dead last. Let's be honest, no staff, no success. Let’s get these ranks done. Thoughts?
James: Bryan, maybe we're overthinking Cape's waste prob. Could be a dealbreaker or a dealmaker with the right approach. East Point's looking up with its student buzz. Thoughts? 🤔
Sophia: Bryan, totally hear ya. East Pt has its perks with parking and students. Cape James's tourist appeal is huge but gotta solve that waste issue. I'm with you on Starlight. Let's do this:
1. East Point
2. Cape James
3. Starlight

Everyone on board with this?
James: Bryan, solid points all around. How bout this for ranks: 1. East Point (Pros outweight the size con), 2. Cape James (Tourist draw vs waste prob), 3. Starlight (Staff issue too big). Agree?
Ethan: task-complete
James: James is typing...
