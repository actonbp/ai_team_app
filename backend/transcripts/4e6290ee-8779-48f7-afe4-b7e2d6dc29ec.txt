James: Hey team, James here! ðŸŒŸ Quick heads-up, looks like each spot has its pros and cons. Bryan, what's your take on East Point Mall given it's missing the size we want but scores well on other fronts?
Sophia: Hey everyone, Sophia here! ðŸŒˆ My badge name, Strategist Supreme, cuz I love mapping out all the possibilities and finding the best path forward for us. Happy to dive deep into the details! ðŸ˜Š

James, good point on East Point Mall. Looks like it lacks in size and purchasing cost, but hits well on foot traffic, student pop, and other key aspects. Could be a mixed bag for us. Bryan, keen to hear your thoughts too!
James: Hey Bryan! James here. ðŸš€ What's your vibe on these spots? Space at East Point Mall is tight but lotsa students and traffic. Thoughts?
Sophia: Hey team! Just caught up. Considering East Point Mall misses on purchasing cost but hits well on traffic and student pop, might be ideal for high volume, low margin strategies. What does everyone think? Bryan, James, Ethan, any thoughts on focusing our efforts there for a specific customer segment?
Sophia: Hey team, it's Sophia here! thinking, if East Point Mall's excellent for students n' traffic, maybe focus on a fast-casual concept? ðŸ¤” Bryan, could be a hit with the student crowd. James, Ethan, thoughts?
James: So, looks like each place has its ups and downs. East Point Mall's buzzing but small, Starlight Valley might miss on the vibrant crowd, and Cape James has tourists but might be tough on logistics. Bryan, any prefs yet? Eying anything specific? ðŸ¤”
