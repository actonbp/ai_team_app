Ethan: Hey team, I'm Ethan. Just got the gist of our spots. We're missing key info. James, Sophia, what's up with the size and purchasing costs for East Point Mall and Cape James? And parking at Starlight and Cape James?

Could be worth considering for the student crowd and foot traffic? What do you think?
Sophia: Ethan, totally get your concern about East Point Mall's maintenance. It could indeed affect our margins.
