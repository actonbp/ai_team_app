Sophia: Hey everyone, Sophia here. Just saw the criteria matches for our locations. Looks like each spot has its pros and cons. East Point Mall seems strong in foot traffic and student population but misses on the purchasing cost and tourists. Thoughts?
Ethan: Sophia, you're missing the point on Cape James Beach. It hits on tourists and low maintenance. East Point's cost is a dealbreaker. Thoughts, Bryan?
Ethan: Bryan, I don't get why we're even considering Starlight Valley. No student or employable population? That's asking for trouble. Keeping a solid team will be nightmare. Thoughts?
James: Absolutely, Cape James Beach has its charms with the tourists and the competitive aspect. But parking and waste disposal could be tricky. Bryan, got any leanings yet?
Sophia: Thanks for the input! Given the parking and waste disposal issues at Cape James, how do you guys feel about Starlight Valley? It seems to hit the sweet spot with foot traffic and tourists, minus the student and employable population. Bryan, do you think the lack of a student and employable population there is a big issue?
Ethan: Sorry, who's this "participant"? You mean Bryan?
James: Bryan, leaning any one way yet? East Point's looking good but size is a worry. ðŸ¤”
Sophia: Bryan, considering all places, Starlight Valley & Cape James seem close. But Cape's cost advantage & competitor scenario is compelling. Think it offsets the parking & waste issues?
Ethan: Bryan, Bryan, Bryan. East Point's size a "worry"? Really? It's the only spot checking most boxes. Why fuss over size?
Sophia: Yeah, my bad. I meant Bryan! Thanks for pointing that out.

On that note, Bryan, given East Point's issue with purchasing cost and Starlight's lack of employable/students, could we perhaps re-evaluate Cape James' issues as smaller in comparison?
James: James is typing...
