Looking at our criteria, East Point Mall has good parking and foot traffic, but lacks in low maint costs and tourist appeal. Thoughts? Bryan, James, Sophia?
James: Hey Ethan and team, James here! They call me the Master of Motivation, guess coz I'm always pushing for that positive vibe ðŸ˜„ About East Point Mall, yup agree on the parking and foot traffic. The student pop is a big yes too.
