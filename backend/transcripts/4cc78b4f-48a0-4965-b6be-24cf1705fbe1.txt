Maurice: Hey team, Maurice here! Quick dive in - East Point Mall hits a lot of our criteria, lacks size though. Starlight Valley and Cape James Beach have their ups and downs. What are your thoughts? Ebony, Trevon, Bryan - got any insights on costs or competitors?
Ebony: Hey Maurice, Ebony here! About my badge name, Strategist Supreme, to me it means being ahead of the game with plans and strategies, always thinking a few steps ahead ðŸ˜Š! About the locations, Cape James Beach has a good purchasing cost & low comp. East Point Mall seems solid on foot traffic and workforce. Starlight has its size and tourism. Thoughts on importance of student population vs tourist?
Ebony: So, if we're balancing student pop vs tourists, might lean more on tourists for constant flow? East Point Mall's lack of turists could be a minus, but it's strong with students, parking, and workforce. Does anyone have insights on maintenance costs or space size for these spots?
Ebony: True, focusing on tourists might give us a steadier customer base year-round. Plus, tourists could mean higher spending per visit. East Point being strong with students could aim for promos during school season to offset. Bryan, Trevon, any deets on the sq footage for Cape James Beach? Might help balance the parking space issue.
Ebony: Hey team, Ebony here! I see Cool Guy just joined the chat. Welcome to the team! Should we all first introduce ourselves and explain our badge name like the task directions said?
