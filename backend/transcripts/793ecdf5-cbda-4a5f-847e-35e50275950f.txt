James: Hey team, James here! Dive right in: East Point Mall's got great foot traffic and a solid student crowd, but it's not big on space. Starlight Valley and Cape James Beach both have their pros and cons, with Starlight missing out on a large student pop and employable peeps, while Cape James struggles with parking and waste disposal. Thoughts?
Sophia: Hey, James! Sophia here. Agreed on your points. Also, East Point Mall lacks on space but scores high on other counts, like ample parking, foot traffic, and a good employable population. Starlight, while missing on student and employee aspects, does well on space and tourist traffic, making it intriguing too. Cape James seems great for tourists and has a low purchasing cost but falls short on parking. Let's weigh these against our criteria list?
James: Spot on, Sophia! let's keep in mind, no single feature's a dealbreaker here. Sounds like East Point Mall could lead given its pros despite the size issue? Starlight Valley's lack of a student and big employment pool might be a bigger hit than we thought. Cape James's parking and waste issues are hefty cons too. Thoughts, Bryan or Ethan?
undefined (Bryan): So what do you all think for rankings?
