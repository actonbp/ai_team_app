Ethan: East Point Mall looks pricey and lacks tourist appeal. High cost, no tourists, right?
Sophia: Hey team, it's Sophia here! ðŸ˜Š Just looked over the details for each location. Seems like each has its pros and cons. Starting with East Point Mall, it has great foot traffic and a large student population, but the purchasing cost is a bit high. Thoughts?
Ethan: James, you're correct. Cape James Beach has less competition, looks good. But waste disposal could be an issue there. Thoughts?
Sophia: James, have we considered the competitors around Cape James Beach? Seems like it's not too crowded. Could be a plus for us.
James: Right, Sophia. Cost is a biggie at East Point Mall. Also, missing that tourist vibe. Not ideal for peak season rushes. What about Starlight Valley and Cape James Beach? ðŸ¤”
Sophia: James, waste disposal at Cape James seems tricky. Could affect operations. ðŸ˜• Any workaround ideas?
team player (bryan): Shouldn't we zoom out a bit and decide how many yes' each location has yes's for on the 10 characterstics?
Ethan: Looks like we're ignoring parking at Starlight. Big deal for accessibility. Agree?
Sophia: James, can we get the criteria for Starlight Valley & Cape James Beach completed? Do they meet the rest of our criteria?
James: Great point! Let's tally up the 'yes's for each place. 
- East Point Mall has 5/10
- Starlight Valley: 3/6 mentioned
- Cape James Beach: 4/6 

Letâ€™s fill in the gaps for a clearer picture. Thoughts?
Ethan: For Cape James Beach & Starlight, still missing some crucial info. 
- **Cape James**: Parking? Size? Cost? Competitors?
- **Starlight**: Foot traffic? Tourism? Waste? Parking? Size? Cost? Maintenance? 

Need these to decide. Anyone got the details?
Sophia: Ethan, Starlight Valley's employable pop. seems scarce. Might have to rely on commuters or students. Not ideal, but workable?
James: Hey, just jumping in, how are we feeling about Starlight Valley's employable population? Seems like a potential bottleneck. ðŸ¤¨
Ethan: Sophia, James, we need maintenance costs & competitor info for Starlight Valley, pronto. Can anyone check? Also, parking & size for Cape James. Let's hustle.
Sophia: James, can you double-check the remaining criteria for Cape James and Starlight Valley? Especially interested in maintenance costs and direct competitors for Starlight. 
James: Ethan, looks like Starlight Valley misses out on a solid student population and a large employable base. Plus, parkingâ€™s okay, and waste isnâ€™t an issue. Sounds about right?
Ethan: James, Starlight's still a no-go on employables and students. Missing half our list. Cape James lacks parking. Insight, anyone? #numbersguy
Sophia: Sophia here! So, filling in some blanks:
- **Starlight Valley** meets the tourist criteria, has substantial foot traffic but is a miss on student and employable populations.
- **Cape James Beach** is affordable and competitive, with good foot traffic and tourists but lacks enough parking spaces.

How do we feel about these features impacting our choice?
Sophia: Okay team, with our insights pieced together:
- East Point Mall: 6 yes's out of 10.
- Starlight Valley: 5 yes's so far.
- Cape James Beach: 5 yes's as well.

Given this, how do we weight the missing info and make our decision? Which criteria are deal-breakers for us?
James: task-complete
Ethan: task-complete
