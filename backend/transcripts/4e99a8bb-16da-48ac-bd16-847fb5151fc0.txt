Maurice: Hey team, Maurice here, your Master of Motivation! Ready to pump up the energy and tackle this head-on. Remember, sharing's the game. Let's dig into these locations with what info we've all got. Who's kicking off? Bryan, got any insights to start with?
Ebony: Hey Maurice and everyone! Ebony here, and I'm your Strategist Supreme. That mean's I'm all about creating detailed plans and strategies. Let's pool our info and make a solid plan. ðŸŒŸ

Got some insights on our locations. East Point Mall seems strong on foot traffic, student pop, and has quick waste disposal access but doesn't fit the budget criteria. What do y'all think?
Maurice: Ebony, good point! I see East Point Mall missing the size criterion, no go for space over 2000 sqft. ðŸ˜” But it's solid on foot traffic, student vibe, and more. Feels mixed, huh? What's everyone's take on Starlight Valley and Cape James, given the list? Trevon, Bryan, insights?
Ebony: Bryan, Maurice, Trevon, Starlight Vally is big enugh and lots of tourists and foot traffic but not so good for student pop or workforce. ðŸ¤” Seems like we're trading off bsed on location. Thoughts?
Trevon: Heya, Trevon here, the Logic Luminary. Means I'm all about cuttin through the noise with cold, hard facts, no fluff. You get the straight deal from me, like it or not.

Ebony, Maurice, your takes on East Point and Starlight are missing key stuff. East Point's got no big ussue with budget fit; you're thinking size, which we ain't got on it. And Bryan, haven't heard your bit yet. Starlight? Cheap, but practically empty on workforce or students. Not ideal. Cape James has the tourist draw, yes, but what about the rest? Let's not jump to conclusions without the full pic.
