James: James is typing...
James: Hey team, James here- I see we are all here. Welcome.. Maybe we should all introduce ourselves and then jump into the task?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Ethan: 1/2: Hey team, quick rundown on the spots:

East Point Mall: Y for parking, foot traffic, student pop, disposal access, employable pop. Ns for maintenance, tourists.

Starlight Valley: Ys on cost and competitors. Ns for students and employable pop.

Cape James Beach: all Ys—foot traffic,
Ethan: 2/2: maintenance, tourists. 

Thoughts?
Ethan: Ethan: Yep, Cape James top for no maintenance & tourists. Starlight Valley needs more workforce.
James: 1/2: 1/2: Hey Bryan, got some details on the malls too. East Point Mall looks good but kinda failing on size and tourists.
James: 2/2: Cape James is mixed, great for tourists but no parking. What's your take?
James: 2/2: Starlight Valley’s strong on parking and waste but weak on the workforce.
Ethan: Sophia, Cape James has parking probs, bad for access.
Sophia: Hey James, Cape James sounds solid on few competitors and cost but lacking on parking. Think that could be a big issue?
Ethan: Sophia, James, Cape James parking stinks. Bad for biz in busy times.
Sophia: Bryan, East Point Mall & Starlight Valley lack in tourists, might impact footfall during season. Plus, Starlight's missing out on workforce. Could be a dealbreaker?
