Ethan: Hey team, Ethan here. Quick rundown, East Point ticks a lot of boxes, but its maintenance costs are a no-go. Starlight's cheap and competitor-free but lacks workforce and students. Cape James seems prime for traffic and keeping things cheap. Thoughts? Bryan, any inputs on these points?
James: Ethan, East Point's foot traffic and student presence sounds good. High maintenance tho, huh? At Starlight, lacking workforce's a bummer. Cape James lacks parking and trash options, not ideal. Bryan, seen anything to add or correct here?
Sophia: Ethan, Bryan, quick thought on East Point considering maintenance: its high traffic & student draw might offset costs. Starlightâ€™s perfect size but missing key demographics. Cape James is appealing for price and tourists, yet lacks on parking & waste. How do these balance out for us?
Sophia: Ethan, Bryan, considering everything, it seems East Point has a mix of pros but a cost concern. Starlight lacks in workforce and students which can be crucial for us. Cape James looks promising on cost & traffic but falls short on parking & waste disposal. Should we weigh in more on what can be compensated or is a dealbreaker?
