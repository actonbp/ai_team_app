James: Hey, so East Point Mall's looking okay with decent foot traffic and enough parking. Starlight Valley's not great. Cape James Beach is average.
James: East Point Mall's got decent foot traffic, parking's okay, not many tourists though. Starlight Valley's kinda lacking in workforce and students. Cape James, mixed bag, tough parking, good for tourists, not many competitors.
James: East Point Mall checks most boxes except size and tourists. Seems to be leading.
James: Yeah, East Point's alright for workforce and students. Starlight Valley’s kinda empty, lacks workers and students. Cape’s touristy but no parking. Just weighing the options.
James: Hey Bryan, East Point Mall has decent parking, foot traffic, student presence, waste management, and workforce. But it's small and not much for tourists.
