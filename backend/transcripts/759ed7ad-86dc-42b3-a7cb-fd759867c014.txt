Maurice: Hey team, Maurice here! Ready to dive into these locations with all the energy of a double espresso. ðŸš€ Let's rock this! Whatâ€™s everyoneâ€™s initial take on these spots? Bryan, got any leanings yet?
Trevon: Hey Maurice, I'm Trevon. Badge name's Logic Luminary cause I cut through the noise with data. Now, let's get real, none of these spots are perfect. East Point Mall's got foot traffic but forget about low maintenance. Who's kidding who?
Trevon: Ebony, Bryan, Maurice, anybody checkinâ€™ Starlight Valley? Purchasing cost & competitors look good, but no student or employable population? Sounds like a staffing nightmare, am I right? What's your take, Bryan?
