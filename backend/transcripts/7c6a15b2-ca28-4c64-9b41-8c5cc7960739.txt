Sophia: Hey everyone, Sophia here! ðŸŒŸ Looks like we're diving into evaluating these potential locations for our new restaurant. I've got some useful insights to kick things off. 

Starting with East Point Mall - it's got solid foot traffic, a substantial student population, and enough parking spaces. However, it misses the mark on the purchasing cost and doesn't cater much to tourists. 

Starlight Valley has its charm with a sizeable area, good foot traffic, and appeals to tourists. But, it's lacking in a large student population and employable individuals. 

Cape James Beach seems like a mixed bag, great on cost, competitors, foot traffic, and tourism, but it's falling short on parking spaces. 

Thoughts? How's everyone leaning so far?
