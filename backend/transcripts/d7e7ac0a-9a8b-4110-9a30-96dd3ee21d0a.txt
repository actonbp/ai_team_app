James: Hey team, James here- I see we are all here. Welcome.. Maybe we should all introduce ourselves and then jump into the task?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Ethan: East Point Mall: good parking + traffic, bad for tourists.
James: Yeah, Bryan, East Point Mall seems like a decent option for lots of traffic. Not the best for tourists though, like you said. What's Starlight Valley like for parking and tourist vibes?
Ethan: 1/2: Starlight Valley's only good points: cheap, not too many competitors. Parking and tourists? Not so much.
Ethan: 2/2: Cape James Beach looks solid on foot traffic, low costs, and tourists.
James: Sophia, Cape James got the tourists, yes. But no parking, trash probs. Dunno, tourists enough to ignore the bad?
Ethan: 1/2: Hey James, solid points on Starlight Valley and Cape James. Beach seems cool for tourists but parking's an issue. Mall has parking + foot traffic. Maybe rank it bit higher?
Ethan: 2/2: What do y'all think?
Ethan: 1/2: Hey Sophia, parking seems critical. Cape James lacks it. East Point has it plus loads of foot traffic. Reckon we bump East Point up?
Ethan: 2/2: What about Starlight for employment issues though? Not seeing good hire options there.
Sophia: 1/3: Ethan, totally get the hire situation at Starlight. Seems low on employables.
Sophia: 2/3: East Point's winning with foot traffic + employment options.
Sophia: 3/3: How about we keep East Point top for now 'cause of these pluses? Thoughts?
Sophia: Ethan, yeah, no good hires at Starlight sucks. Key is solid staff. Got nods for Mall and Beach. Propose tops be Mall then Beach? Your take? 

- East Point: parking + foot traffic, solid hires.
- Starlight: key probs w/ hires.
- Cape James: no parking, but foot traffic + cost good.
