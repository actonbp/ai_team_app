Ethan: Hey folks, Ethan here. Just looked over our info. East Point Mall got 5 Ys like good parking and foot traffic, but maintenance might be a prob. Starlight Valley’s got a few issues, not much manpower available. Cape James Beach looks decent, all Ys on its checks. Thoughts?
Ethan: Yeah, Cape James Beach seems solid with no nos. Just saying, might score high cuz of that. How we ranking these?
James: Hey Sophia, got a lil mix-up there. Cape James Beach actually has only 3 Ys and 3 Ns. Not all Ys. How we all feel about East Point Mall with 5 Ys but biggie is it’s not that large?
Sophia: Ah gotcha, Bryan. I mixed Cape James info. East Point Mall's looking good on most fronts except size and cost. Parking, foot traffic, and labor pool are pros. Starlight’s big on space but not much on staff available, right?

Ethan: Hey all, quick rundown, East Point Mall seems decent, got 5 YESes like 50+ parking & good foot traffic. Starlight Valley and Cape James got fewer YESes but no trespassing with big NOs at Cape James. Thoughts?
James: Hey, looking at Cape James not having enough parking is a drag, plus no quick trash handling, might tick off the beach goers. Not so cool for a busy spot, huh?
Ethan: Hey Bryan, Cape James does handle maintenance and tourists well, got that right from the get-go. Still, the parking and waste could be better there fosho.
Sophia: True that, James. Actually, East Point Mall's got a bunch of yeses like the big parking and foot traffic. Plus quick trash handling? Seems solid for busy times.
