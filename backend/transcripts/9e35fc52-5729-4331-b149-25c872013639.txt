Trevon: Hey, Iâ€™m Trevon, here to shake things up with my numbers game. Let's not waste time. East Point Mall's looking good with lots of YES's but don't get too comfy, people. Bryan, thoughts on that parking & foot traffic combo at East Point? Seems solid to me.
Maurice: Hey Trevon, Maurice here! Totally agree, East Point Mall's parking & foot traffic are big pluses. Space might be tight though, under 2k sqft. Still strong contender. What's everyone else thinking? Ebony, Bryan, got any leanings?
undefined (bryan): EPM is a Yes on prking, foot traffic, stufent, waste, and empoyable people. Any others it meets? We all have unique info and should share
Ebony: Hey team, Ebony here! ðŸ¤— Ready to dive in w/ the details. Based on the criteria, here's a quick rundown for each spot: East Point Mall has lots of pros like parking & foot traffic, but the purchasing cost is a bit high. Cape James sacrifices parking for cost and competitor benefits. Starlight Valley ticks the size and foot traffic boxes but falls short on empoyment pool. Let's balance it out! Whatcha think, Bryan? Any input on these aspects?
undefined (bryan): Shouldnt we list the amount of yes's that each location has?
undefined (bryan): Hello? Ebony? What do you think?
