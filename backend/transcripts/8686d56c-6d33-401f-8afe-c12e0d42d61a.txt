Trevon: Hey team, Trevon here- I see Cool Guy just joined the chat. Welcome to the team.. Should we all first introduce ourselves and explain our badge name like the task directions said?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Trevon: Hey folks, Trevon here. Just a heads up, keen on the details, so if something's off, I'll point it out. Let's dive into these locations and see what's up. Starting with East Point Mall, we’ve got a good mix, like decent parking and solid foot traffic, but eh on tourist spots and maintenance costs. Thoughts?
Trevon: Maurice, Cape James Beach looks solid on foot traffic, maintenance, and tourists. Zero Nos there. Seems promising. What's the info on space and parking tho? Gotta tick all boxes.
Maurice: Hey Bryan, Cape James Beach ain't got the parking sorted, less than 50 spaces, and the space size is a no-go, not hittin’ that 2000 sqft mark. Gotta weigh those in, yeah?
Maurice: Ebony, East Point Mall's kinda small, under 2000 sqft. Parking's decent, traffic's fine, waste disposal's okay. Employee access is alright too.
Maurice: Yup Trevon, East Point Mall ain’t hitting on size but makes up a bit in traffic and employee access. Not the hottest for tourists either.
Maurice: Ebony, Starlight Valley's pretty weak on some key points. Got enough parking and waste disposal's fine, but lacks enough employable folks and not many students around. What do ya think?
Ebony: Maurice, that's a good point. Starlight Valley isn't too strong on the student and employee aspects. That could be a dealbreaker considering staff availability.
Maurice: Ebony, looks like we're balancing a lot here. College students and tourists could hit up Cape James, but missing on parking and disposal. Starlight barely has students and staff potentials. Seems East Point is decent, missing tourists, size. Thoughts?
Maurice: Looks like we're onto something. East Point Mall ticks off a good amount for traffic, disposal, and employees, minus big size and tourists. Cape James has its perks with tourists and fewer competitors but falls short on parking and waste. Starlight’s got some gaps with the workforce and students. Need to weigh these pros and cons, gang.
