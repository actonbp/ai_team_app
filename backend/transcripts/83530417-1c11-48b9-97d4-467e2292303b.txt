Trevon: Hey Bryan! Trevon here. Quick on the deets: East Point Mall says yes to the parking, foot traffic, student pop, waste disposal, and employability, so we're good there. But no to low maint costs and tourist pop. How's it looking for the other locations?

Kinda half-half, yeah? How's this stack up?
