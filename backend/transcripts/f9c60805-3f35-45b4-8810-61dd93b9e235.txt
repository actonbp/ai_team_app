Sophia: Sophia is typing...
Sophia: Hey team, Sophia here- I see we are all here. Welcome.. Maybe we should all introduce ourselves and then jump into the task?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Ethan: Hey, it’s Ethan. So, East Point Mall has 5 yes's but 2 no's, though tourists and maintenance are issues. Starlight Valley’s cheaper but misses some marks, got only 2 yes's. Cape James Beach does well with traffic, costs, and tourists. Any opinions?
James: Hey Ethan, East Point Mall seems okay - most folks are down except for the usual complaints about size and tourists. Starlight? Not really feeling it. And Cape James has issues, parking and trash being big ones. Thoughts?
Sophia: Hey, Sophia here. So I've looked over the stats. East Point Mall's doing okay with foot traffic and has some students and working people around. Starlight Valley's pretty big, attracts tourists, but not great for students or jobs.
Sophia: Cape James has parking issues, but it's cheap,
Sophia: not too crowded, and tourists seem to like it.
James: Yeah, Sophia, guess East Point Mall is decent enough for the gig. Not too many tourists around though. Cape James is a bit of a hassle, parking’s always a pain. And Starlight? It’s alright, just the usual – parking’s okay, not too dirty.
Ethan: James, Cape James parking isn’t as bad as you said. It’s alright. And Sophia, yeah East Point’s busy enough, just the tourists and expenses are a bit much. Starlight? Not much happening there with jobs or anything.
