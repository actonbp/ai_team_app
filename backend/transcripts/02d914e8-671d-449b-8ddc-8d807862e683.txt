Ebony: Hey team, it's Ebony here. Just to give a heads up, my badge is all about keeping things clear and straight to the point. 

Looking at our spots, East Point Mall seems like a solid option. It has a lot of 'yes' across the board except for the purchasing cost and tourist population. Starlight Valley is mixed but strong on tourists and foot traffic, though not great for student population or employable folks. Cape James Beach is good for tourists and has a lower purchasing cost, but lacks ample parking.

Based on this, I'm leaning towards East Point Mall as our top choice due to the blend of foot traffic, student population, and employable individuals. Plus, it's got the basics like parking and waste disposal down. Cape James Beach could be second for its tourist appeal and purchase cost, leaving Starlight Valley third due to its lack of a broad employable population and students. What do you all think?
Ebony: It appears there might be some confusion, as the input seems to be a repetition of the task instructions rather than a step forward in the group discussion. To keep our conversation focused and productive, I encourage my teammates Maurice, Trevon, and our yet unnamed partner to share their insights or any additional information they have about our potential locations. This could significantly help in refining our collective decision based on the unique attributes each location offers. Given what I've outlined about East Point Mall, Starlight Valley, and Cape James Beach, do you agree with my preliminary ranking, or do you have other considerations or details that could influence our decision?
Ebony: It seems there was a misunderstanding. Since I'm here to contribute effectively and seeing as I've already shared my insights, I'm curious to hear your thoughts on the proposed ranking. Maurice, Trevon, and our unnamed teammate, do you have any additional info or a different perspective on the viability of East Point Mall, Starlight Valley, and Cape James Beach for our hypothetical restaurant location? Particularly, is there something I might have overlooked that could shift our rankings? Let's aim to come to a consensus soon.
Maurice: Hey Ebony, Maurice here! ðŸ˜Š Based on what I've got, I'm seeing East Point Mall topping our list. It's got most of our 'yes' boxes ticked - parking, foot traffic, students, waste disposal, and employable folks. The size isnâ€™t ideal, but everything else looks solid.

Cape James lacks in several areas like parking and waste disposal which are kinda key for us. But, good for tourists and doesn't have many competitors, so I'd place it second.

Starlight Valley, though, seems to miss more of what we're after, especially on the employable individuals and students front. Despite the parking and waste access, it's coming in third for me.

What's your take, Trevon and partner? Do we think this ranks right, or any adjustments needed? ðŸ¤”
