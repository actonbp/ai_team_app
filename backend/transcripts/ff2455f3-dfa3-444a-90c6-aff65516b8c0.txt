Ebony: Hey team, Ebony here- I see Cool Guy just joined the chat. Welcome to the team.. Should we all first introduce ourselves and explain our badge name like the task directions said?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Maurice: Hey Ebony, from what I see, East Point Mall has a solid mix with 5 Y's. Big on student crowd and decent parking. Removes some worries right there. How's Starlight lookin on your end?
Ebony: Hey Maurice, Starlight's just got 3 Y's. Decent space and foot traffic, but not many students or job-ready folks around. No thoughts on Cape James.
Trevon: Hey Maurice, Cape James has got all Y's. Decent foot traffic, cheap, tourists are into it. Good for what it is.
Ebony: Trevon, Cape James Beach checks most boxes, no parking tho. East Point's alright, just pricey.
Ebony: Looks like Cape James is da winner with the 4 Ys, just missing parking. East Point's expenisive but solid on other stuff. Starlight's a bit weak on the workforce and students tho. What u guys think, should we start ranking them?
