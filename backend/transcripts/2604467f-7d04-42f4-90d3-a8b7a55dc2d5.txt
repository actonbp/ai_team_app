Ebony: Hey team, Ebony here! Looking foward to diving into these potential locations with you all. I've got detailes on each that'l help us decide. Just FYI, I'm all about details and plans, hence the name. Can't wait to hear what you guys think! 

Maurice, Trevon, Bryan, what's your take on the parking space situation at these locations? Important for customer access, right?
Maurice: Hey Ebony! Yup, parking's key. East Point & Starlight Valley both tick the box with enough spaces. Cape James not so much. Thoughts? Bryan, Trevon?
Trevon: Hey, I'm Trevon. Known for being straight to the point, so don‚Äôt mind the short messages. Ebony, Maurice, Bryan, parking is just a start. East Point Mall wins there, but don't forget other stuff like maintenance and tourists. Let's dig deeper, not just parking.
Maurice: True, Trevon. East Point's solid on parking. But it‚Äôs kinda small, no room to grow. Starlight's the same, plus no student vibes there. Cape James has tourists but no parking. Tough balance, huh? What's our vibe? Space, students, or tourists? Bryan, thoughts?
Maurice: Yeah, Trevon, Ebony, got a point. East Point's big on students + foot traffic. Starlight's kinda lacking on peeps üòÖ. Cape James? Tourist spot but that parking... üöó‚ùå. What‚Äôs winning for us, team? Vibe check! Bryan?
Ebony: Looks like East Point's hitting lots except the price tag. Starlight's missing on students + employment, Cape James has a few yes's incl price & tourists. Could be about what we value more? Thoughts on prio? Maurice, Trevon? Bryan?
Maurice: Ebony, Trevon, Bryan, let's tally up yes's and no's? Like Ebony said, details key. East Point got most yes's but space issa no. Cape James got the tourists, less yes's tho. Starlight's kinda in the middle? Bryan, your pick? Priorities matter here. üí°
Trevon: Maurice, tally‚Äôs good but we're missing the point. East Point's crowded, not just students. Tourists matter. Cape James fits. Starlight? Cheap, but dead. Let's not waste time. Bryan, Maurice, priorities? Come on!
Trevon: Maurice, Cape James tourist vibe's good, but let's not ignore the big picture. East Point's got foot traffic AND students. And hey, not all about cost. Quality matters. Ebony, thoughts? Bryan's input would really help rn.
Ebony: Might've jumped the gun on Cape James cuz of the tourist thing. But East Point's practical, students + traffic = good biz. Starlight...maybe if we think tourism over students? Hard to ignore East Point's pros. Trevon, Maurice, thoughts? Bryan, weigh in pls!
Ebony: Team, hear me out. Let's focus on the big pic. East Point hits on most, 'cept price. Might be worth it for the crowd it brings. Starlight? Space, but no student or employee base. Cape James? Tourist + price, but parking's an issue. IMO, might lean East Point, Starlight, then Cape James for the balance. What do you guys think? Bryan, Maurice, Trevon?
Trevon: Ebony, that's not it. East Point's not just about the crowd; maintenance's a nightmare. You're missing the wider costs. And Bryan, think more about growth limits at Cape James. Starlight? Seems too dead. My take? East Point still leads, but not by much. Maurice, Ebony, think past the surface. Bryan?
