Trevon: Hey team, Trevon here- I see we are all here. Welcome.. Maybe we should all introduce ourselves and then jump into the task?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Maurice: Yo Bryan, East Point Mall is up first. Got 5 yes's (parking, peeps around, students, trash, jobs) but nah for size & tourists. Whatcha think?
Trevon: Yo Bryan, Trevon here (aka Number Cruncher). Just took a quick look at East Point. Yeah, it’s got good parking and it's busy and all that, but it ain’t so hot on maintenance or tourists. Not feelin' it too much. What's the group's take?
Maurice: Yeah Trev, gotcha on East Point probs. Still, it's not too bad. How's Starlight Valley and Cape James shaping up?
