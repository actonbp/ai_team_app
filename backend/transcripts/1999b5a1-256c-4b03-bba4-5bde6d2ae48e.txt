James: Hey team, James here! I see Cool Guy just joined the chat. Welcome to the team! I'll start us off since I've been here the longest.... Hey y'all! It's James here, the Master of Motivation! Think of me as your personal hype man. Ready to dive in and make this project shine.
Ethan: East Point's parking ain't an issue but maintenance costs? Big red flag. Cape James sounds like a deal but lacks on some points. Thoughts? Bryan?
Sophia: Hey team, it's Sophia here! Ready to dive into the location details and work together to decide the best spot for Big Restaurant. Just caught up on the details for East Point Mall, Starlight Valley, and Cape James Beach. Let's start with parking needs. Looks like East Point Mall and Cape James Beach meet different criteria. East Point has enough parking but Cape James Beach is affordable. Thoughts? Bryan, any preferences based on this?
