Ethan: Hey team, Ethan here. Let's get straight to it. We need a strategy: share unique info first, then argue our points. I say East Point Mall looks solid *despite* its flaws. Parking and foot traffic are huge wins. Chat away.
Ethan: Sophia, heard anything good about Cape James Beach? Seems to tick boxes without nos. 
Sophia: Bryan, Cape James Beach is looking good tbh! It has lots positives: less than 1MM cost, no too much competition, good foot traffic, and a lot of tourists. But, parking spaces are a bit of an issue. How do we feel about that? Worth the trade-off?
undefined (bryan): What does Ethan think??
James: Hey team, James here! ðŸš€ Let's not forget, we gotta weigh in all the pros and cons for each spot. For East Point Mall, we're looking at solid yes for parking and foot traffic, ++ for student pop and employment pool, but it's not over 2000 sqft, and tourists aren't flocking there. Thoughts? How we feeling 'bout size vs foot traffic trade-off? ðŸ¤” Bryan, got any leans yet?
Ethan: Sophia, foot traffic at Cape James is not an issue. Got it wrong. It's a yes there. And James, size wasn't in my pros or cons. Let's stick to facts. Bryan, thoughts on ignoring size for now?
Ethan: James, let's not mix things. East Point's got more yesses than you said. And Sophia, Cape James sounds overhyped. It's all about balance. Tourists yes, but what about employabiility? Not seeing it. Bryan, we can't ignore employment potential, right?
