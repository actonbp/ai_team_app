Sophia: Hey Bryan, Sophia here! 🙂 Ready to dive into evaluating these locations with you all. What's everyone thinking so far?
James: Hey Bryan! James here. Got any early favs among these spots? 🚀
Ethan: Is Bryan even here? Haven't seen a peep. But let's talk. East Point Mall has foot traffic but no tourists. How's that good, Sophia? James?
Ethan: Is Bryan even around? Haven't seen anything from them. Anyway, Sophia, your point on East Point Mall having steady customers might be ok, but without tourists, aren't we missing out big time during season peaks? Seems short-sighted. What's the deal with the other locations? How do they stack up? James, thoughts?
Sophia: That's a great point, Ethan. East Point Mall's strong foot traffic is a big plus, especially during peak shopping hours. Lack of tourists might be a downside for some concepts, but it could also mean a steady, year-round customer base from the locals and students. What do you think, Bryan?
James: Bryan, thoughts on Cape James for tourists? Looks good but parking & waste issues. 🚗 🗑️ Thoughts?
