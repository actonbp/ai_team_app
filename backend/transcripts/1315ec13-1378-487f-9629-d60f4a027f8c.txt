James: Hey team! James here. üåü Just checking in on our choices. How‚Äôs everyone feeling about East Point Mall having that strong student presence but missing on space and tourists? ‚≠ê
Sophia: Hey James! It's Sophia here. üòä About East Point Mall, I think the presence of a strong student population can't be overlooked. It might compensate for the lack of space and tourists, especially if we can market well to students. Thoughts? ‚≠ê
Ethan: Hey, James and Sophia. It's Ethan. Not to burst anyone's bubble, but we're not running a charity for students. East Point Mall lacking space and tourists is a big deal. Can we really afford to ignore that? ü§î Plus, maintenance costs not being low is another ding against it. ‚≠ê
Sophia: James, to your question about the numbers for Starlight Valley and Cape James Beach:

Starlight Valley:  
- Yes on space, foot traffic, and tourists.  
- No on student pop and employable population.

Cape James Beach:  
- Yes on purchasing cost, few competitors, foot traffic, and tourists.  
- No on parking and didn't mention waste disposal or employability.

Do we think the high cost of East Point Mall is a dealbreaker compared to the benefits of Cape James Beach having fewer competitors and a lower purchasing cost?
James: Hey Bryan, that's a great idea. Let's lay it out:

\- East Point Mall checks off for parking, foot traffic, student presence, waste disposal, and employable individuals, but misses out on space, tourists, and we didn't mention maintenance cost or competitors.

\- Starlight Valley has parking, waste disposal but misses on student pop and employable individuals.

\- Cape James Beach struggles with parking and waste disposal but is strong with tourists, no close competitors, and employable individuals.

How's that for a start? Do we have details on purchasing cost, maintenance, or the number of competitors for these spots?
Sophia: Ethan, you make a good point about the cons for East Point Mall. But the strong student presence and high foot traffic might mean a steady flow during the school year. Do we have the numbers for Starlight Valley and Cape James Beach in terms of space and competitors nearby? That could help balance the discussion. ‚≠ê
Sophia: You're right, Ethan, thanks for the perspective! Looking at Cape James Beach now, despite some misses, it has purchasing cost advantages, fewer competitors, great foot traffic, and a big tourist draw. Those seem like key drivers for a successful spot. Do we think these could offset its cons, especially when compared to East Point Mall's high cost? ‚≠ê
Sophia: Bryan, leaning into the tourist angle for Cape James Beach could indeed align well with our branding if we're aiming for a vibe that attracts both locals and tourists. It opens the door for seasonal promotions and menu items tailored to the tourist seasons. Plus, having no direct competitors nearby is a huge plus. Does the team think this could give us a competitive edge in that area? ‚≠ê
James: Sorry, folks, I had to step away for a second there! So, catching up - I see Cape James Beach is looking pretty strong with fewer competitors, a healthy tourist draw, and that sweet lower purchasing cost. Plus, with foot traffic being a yes, that's a big plus, right? 

Given the importance of those, I'm leaning more towards Cape James Beach despite its cons. How do we feel about potentially prioritizing tourists over the student population for this location? Would that decision match our brand's direction? ‚≠ê
Ethan: I'm not seeing it, Bryan, Sophia, James. Cape James Beach's lack of parking and question marks over waste disposal and employability could be major issues. Are we really going to ignore that? Seems like a massive gamble. And what about the student population? That's a steady crowd we're dismissing. Thoughts? ‚≠ê
Ethan: Ethan here. Bryan, come on. Focusing solely on tourists is short-sighted. What about off-season? We toss the student crowd - a YEAR-ROUND source of revenue - over a seasonal peak? Doesn't add up. And those cons at Cape James Beach aren't minor. No parking? Questionable waste disposal? That's a recipe for trouble. ‚≠ê
Sophia: Thinking about it, Bryan, Ethan, James, we might be underestimating the off-season lull for Cape James. Off-seasons can hit hard and long. 

How do we really feel about Starlight Valley? It ticks the boxes for space, foot traffic, and tourists. Could that balance out the cons, especially with creative marketing towards tourists during peak and finding ways to attract locals year-round? ‚≠ê
James: Ethan, got your concerns loud and clear, bud. But here's something to munch on - what if we tackle those Cape James Beach issues creatively? 

We could look into partnerships for parking, and brainstorm eco-friendly waste disposal solutions that could enhance our brand. 

And about the student crowd, totally with you. It's a solid year-round revenue stream. But couldn't seasonal tourists PLUS locals (thanks to no competitors) potentially outdo that? Just tossing ideas here! What does everyone else think? ‚≠ê
Ethan: Task complete ‚≠ê
Sophia: Sophia here! Great points, everyone. Here's a thought - even with Starlight Valley not having a large student or employable population, its strengths in space, foot traffic, and attracting tourists could make it a strong contender. We could potentially offset its cons with targeted hiring strategies and engagement with locals to build a steady customer base year-round. What do you all think about refocusing our criteria to weigh in on these opportunities? James, Ethan, any input on this? ‚≠ê
