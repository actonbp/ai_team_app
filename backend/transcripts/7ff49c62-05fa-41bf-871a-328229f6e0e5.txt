Trevon:  Honestly Maurice, calling that energy? Seems more like you're sippin' on decaf. ðŸ™„ Let's focus, people. Cape James Beach is the only one nailing the tourist vibe. Foot traffic and low costs too? Cmon, that's a solid contender. Ebony, thoughts? Or too busy browsing lunch menus?
Ebony: Hey all! I'm Ebony. My badge name, Strategist Supreme, means I'm all about diving into details and strategizing the best path forward for us. Excited to tackle this with you all!

Looking at East Point Mall, its got good foot traffic, and meets 50 parking spaces, and more but misses on purchase cost. Thoughts from Bryan, Maurice, Trevon?
