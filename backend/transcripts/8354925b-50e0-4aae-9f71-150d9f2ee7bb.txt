Ethan: Hey team, Ethan here. So, looking at East Point Mall, solid foot traffic and decent for students, but tourists? Not so much. Thoughts? Bryan, James, Sophia, what's your take on this?
Sophia: Agreed, Ethan. East Point seems great for student crowd & foot traffic. But no, not for tourists. Tough one for big seasons, right? How do u guys weigh this against the other locations? James, Bryan, thoughts?
Sophia: Totally see where you're coming from, Ethan and Bryan. East Point Mall ticks a lot of boxes but falls short for tourists. Starlight Valley gets the nod for tourists but might struggle with the workforce. Cape James hits different with tourists and is affordable. How do we feel about balancing these aspects? Also, parking at Cape James is a miss. Thoughts?
James: Ethan, Bryan, Sophie, parking at Cape James is a big miss 😬. But tourism is a plus! East Point nailed it on parking, students, and workforce. Starlight... kinda middle ground, huh? What's our priority? 🤔
James: Considering all, East Point might lead with pros like parking, students, and workforce. Cape James strong in tourism but weak on parking/disposal. Starlight's mixed, less workforce. Need to balance. Thoughts, team?
James: Considering the criteria, East Point seems well-rounded, especially for students + parking. Cape James shines for tourists but lacks in disposal + parking. Starlight's in-between, issues with workforce & students. Maybe rank East Point > Cape James > Starlight based on broad criteria fulfillment? Thoughts, Bryan, Ethan, Sophia?
undefined (Bryan): Shouldnt week seek to count how many yes's there are for each location? Remember, each characterstic is equally important per the directions of the task
Ethan: James, your ranking seems off. Weigh all criteria equally. East Point lacks on tourist draw, true, but beats Starlight on workforce/students. Cape James misses parking. Rethink it. East Point > Cape James for broad appeal, Starlight last given its gaps. Counterpoints?
Sophia: Right Bryan, counting "yes" for each criteria across locations makes sense. I'll share my info:

- East Point: 5Y (except tourists, purchasing cost)
- Starlight: 4Y (issues with workforce/students)
- Cape James: 5Y (minus parking, waste disposal)

East Point & Cape James are close. Starlight lags a bit. How does this align with what you guys have?
James: Bryan nailed it with the counting approach. My tally gives East Point a solid win on most fronts except size and tourists. Starlight’s a no-go for the student and workforce scene. Cape James a mixed bag but falls short on parking and disposal. So, thinkin' East Point > Cape James > Starlight? What’s everyone's final take? 🤔
undefined (Bryan): I have 5 yes' s for east point, one for starlight, and four for cape james beach. Rememeber have both unique and shared information
James: Ethan, Bryan, Sophia, tallying up based on all our info, I'm leaning towards East Point > Cape James > Starlight too. East Point's strong on most except size/tourists. Cape James wins with tourists but loses on parking/disposal. Starlight's behind on key aspects. We all in agreement here?
James: Oops, my bad Bryan! Miscounted there. 🙈 Based on the correct count and our discussion:

- East Point: 5Ys. Good for students, workforce, parking.
- Cape James: 4Ys. Tourists 🌴, but parking and waste disposal = 😕.
- Starlight: 3Ys. Fewer benefits overall.

So, do we settle on East Point > Cape James > Starlight, team? Final thoughts? 🏁
undefined (Bryan): I am good with that order: 1) East point 2) Cape James, 3) Starlight!
