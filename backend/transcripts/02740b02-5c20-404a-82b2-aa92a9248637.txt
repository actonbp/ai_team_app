- No: Cost, tourists

Starlight Valley:

- No: Students, employables

Cape James:

Thats it really, what do you think?

East Point Mall: 5 Yes (parking, foot traffic, students, waste, employables); 2 No (cost, tourists)

Starlight Valley: 2 Yes (cost, competitors); 2 No (students, employables)

Cape James: All good, no bad points listed?

That's it.

- Ethan
Sophia: Hey, quick info on Cape James:

- Parking: No
- Cost, Competitors, Foot Traffic, Tourists: Yes

Scores well, just no parking. What you all think?

-Sophia
Ethan: East Point still best - 5 yes. Cape James no parking. Starlight only 2 yes. Thoughts? -Ethan
Sophia: Agreed, Ethan. Looks like East Point has the edge w/ most yeses. Cape James and Starlight Valley could be next in line but Cape's missing parking is also important. Worth noting for decision. What does everyone else think?
James: Looks like East Point takes the lead easily with 5 yesses. I think we should consider how critical each 'no' is at Cape James and Starlight. Parking seems key, esp for a restaurant. What's everyone's take on that? -James
Ethan: 1/2: Good points. East Point seems solid given the coverage on most needs. Parking's definitely a big plus for restaurant goers. Cape's good on cost but no parking is tough. Starlight lacks in several key areas.
Ethan: 2/2: Seems we may have our provisional ranking here?
Sophia: Seems we're leaning towards East Point top, then Cape James, and Starlight last? Do we all agree on this lineup based on our criteria match ups? Let's finalize if everyone's cool with that.

-Sophia
Sophia: Yeah, works for me. East Point, Cape James, Starlight. Cool if we settle on this?

-Sophia
James: East Point, Cape James, Starlight - all set. Let's lock it. -James
