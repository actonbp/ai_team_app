Trevon: Hey everyone - TREVON here. Just so we're clear, don't expect me to fluff things up. I'm all about the facts and couldn't care less if my tone comes off strong. We've got places to rank and no time to waste.

Looking straight at the numbers, East Point Mall seems to take the lead. It ticks off most of what we need: parking, foot traffic, student population, waste disposal, and employable individuals. The only downsides? High maintenance costs and lacks a large tourist draw. Still, from an analytical standpoint, it's the front-runner.

Starlight Valley is barely in the game. Sure, it's cheap and has less competition, but lacking in both a large student and employable population is a significant miss. Literally, what's the point if you can't staff the place or have customers?

Cape James Beach is interesting; good traffic, low upkeep, tourists galore. Sounds like a summer hotspot but what about off-season? High and dry, maybe?

Considering all factors, it's East Point Mall, Cape James Beach, then Starlight Valley from best to least. I'm ready to call out anyone on this. Maurice, Ebony, whoever wants to jump in‚Äîprove me wrong.
Ebony: Hey Trevon, Ebony here. Agreeing with your take on East Point Mall topping the list for its blend of positives, especially for student crowd and workforce. Based on what you said and my data, Starlight Valley's big miss on a student population and employables is a real downside. Also, Cape James Beach not having enough parking is a bummer, but it's cheap and tourist-friendly, which is a huge plus. So, breaking it down, East Point Mall is indeed the best option, followed by Cape James Beach‚Äîthose tourists and low purchasing cost can't be ignored. Starlight Valley, despite its perks, falls last due to lack of essential demographics. Does this align with how you see it, or did I miss something? Looking to hear Maurice and Bryan's thoughts too.
Maurice: Trevon, Ebony, got it. East Point Mall seems our champion, right? üèÜ Good foot traffic, students galore, and solid waste disposal plan. But, size might be an issue, not over 2000 sqft. Still, the pros outweigh that minor con.

Cape James Beach screams summer vibes with those tourists! üåû But, parking's a miss, and no quick trash chucking could get messy. Plus, staffing's fine, but no students might make off-season tough.

Starlight Valley... Parking? Yes. Trash easy? Sure. But, no students or enough people to hire. üö´ Sounds like a staffing nightmare.

So, echoing you both - East Point Mall ü•á, Cape James Beach ü•à, and then, lagging behind, Starlight Valley ü•â. That work for us? Bryan, thoughts?
Trevon: It seems we're skipping a beat here. First off, Maurice, where'd you get the info on size constraints at East Point Mall or staff availability at Cape James Beach? Stick to the facts. Plus, Ebony, cheap and tourist-friendly doesn't cut it if we can barely staff the place year-round. 

Slicing it down: East Point Mall screams winner for its versatility‚Äîstudents, staff, you name it. Cape James, sure, tourists love it, but don't ignore the staffing and off-season slump. Starlight Valley is a dead zone for our needs‚Äîno staff, no students spells disaster.

So, it's still East Point, Cape James, then Starlight. Unless Bryan's got some earth-shattering insight, let's not dance around the obvious. Task-complete?
Ebony: It seems there was a misunderstanding in my previous message, and I appreciate Maurice's and Trevon's insights. Given everyone's observations and my details, we all seem to lean towards East Point Mall as our top choice due to its extensive list of positives despite the higher cost‚Äîa solid spot for both students and a broader employable population.

Cape James Beach certainly has its charm with the tourist appeal and the cost advantage. But the lack of parking and detailed information on waste disposal and staffing could be potential issues, placing it second.

Starlight Valley, while attractive for its space and tourist draw, falls short on critical aspects like employable population and student presence, making it less viable for our venture.

It sounds like we're all generally in agreement, but Bryan, do you see it differently, or does this line-up work for you too?
