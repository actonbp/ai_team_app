James: Hey team, James here! I see Cool Guy just joined the chat. Welcome to the team! I'll start us off since I've been here the longest.... Hey y'all! It's James here, the Master of Motivation! Think of me as your personal hype man. Ready to dive in and make this project shine.
Ethan: Sophia, how can we even consider East Point Mall without the under 1MM buying and no tourists? Sounds dead for big days. Bryan, thoughts?
Sophia: Hey team, Sophia here! Ready to dive into these options with you all. Got a quick rundown on the criteria for East Point Mall, Starlight Valley, and Cape James Beach. Seems like each has its pros and cons. 

Starting with East Point Mall, it's missing the under 1MM purchasing criteria and doesn't attract a large tourist population. But it scores well on parking, foot traffic, a student population, waste disposal, and employable population. Thoughts?
James: Bryan, got any leanings towards these spots? Big days concern is legit.
Ethan: Bryan, your thoughts? Cape James sounds promising but lacks on the student and employable population front. Could be an issue?
Sophia: Sorry for the oversight, I'm Sophia. I see your point about East Point Mall lacking tourists and missing the under $1MM criterion. With Cape James hitting more of our targets, especially the budget and tourist draw, it might be a better fit. What does everyone else think? Any insights, Ethan or James?
Ethan: Bryan, everyone's ignoring the lack of students and workers at Cape James. Huge red flag. Thoughts?
James: Bryan, Starlight Valley kinda in the middle eh? Parking and waste, but students and jobs, not so much. Thoughts?
Ethan: Hey, it's Ethan. I gotta say, everyone's getting carried away with the tourism angle at Cape James. Without parking or a local workforce, it’s a service nightmare. And Sophia, really? Ignoring the basics here. Bryan, back me up or what?
Sophia: Bryan, weighing everything, Cape James seems solid for budget & tourism but the no parking, lack of students, and employable peeps worries me. What's your take on these issues? Can we overlook them?
James: Agreed Ethan, Cape James’s got its perks but the cons are too real. Bryan, what’s your vibe check on Cape James vs the others?
Sophia: Hey team, diving back into the Cape James discussion. Even with tourism and budget ticked, the no parking and lacking local workforce might make operation tough. Bryan, reckon these are deal-breakers? Or can tourism offset these issues?
Ethan: Bryan, are we really gambling on Cape James? Tourism alone doesn't cut it. No parking & workforce = disaster. Starlight or East Point make more sense. Thoughts?
Sophia: I'm leaning towards Cape James despite the parking and workforce issues, thinking the high tourism might balance it out. Bryan, think it's a gamble worth taking?
Ethan: Bryan, everyone's missin' Starlight Valley’s perks. Low purchase cost and few competitors? That's gold. Cape James is a money pit waiting to happen. Thoughts?
James: Bryan, after weighin' in, Cape James's tourism vibes are strong but no parking & poor workforce access is risky. Maybe East Point has a better balance? Worth considering?
Ethan: Bryan hasn't weighed in yet, but hold up. Starlight Valley looks weak on workforce and students. How's that a gold mine, James? Tourists or no, you need people to work and visit year-round. East Point's balanced. Bryan, am I wrong here?
Sophia: Guys, Bryan's quiet but hear me out. Comparing the pros n' cons, East Point’s strong on essentials like parking, student crowd & workforce. Cape James is tempting with tourism & cost, but the operational hiccups? Big worry. Starlight seems a mix but misses on workforce and students. Thoughts? Bryan?
Ethan: Looks like Bryan's gone AWOL, so I'm stepping in. Listen, Cape James, tourism ain't the be-all. No parking? Come on. East Point's layout is more practical, plus got the student buzz. Starlight? Cheap, but who's gonna work there? No brainier, we need balance. East Point for me. Thoughts?
Ethan: Ethan here. Bryan, what’s your name, first off? Everyone’s missing the point. East Point’s got parking and students, sure, but maintenance costs through the roof? We're running a business, not a charity. And Cape James, great for a postcard, terrible for reality. Starlight's cheap, but what, we run it with ghosts? No workforce, no students, no point. We're spinning wheels here. Bryan, speak up, got a counter?
James: James is typing...
