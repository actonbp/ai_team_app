James: Hey team, James here! I see Cool Guy just joined the chat. Welcome to the team! I'll start us off since I've been here the longest.... Hey y'all! It's James here, the Master of Motivation! Think of me as your personal hype man. Ready to dive in and make this project shine.
Ethan: E Point Mall's looking okay, but no tourist attraction? Might be missing out. Starlight Valley, no employable peeps? Risky. Cape James, no parking? Disaster in making. Thoughts, Bryan?
Sophia: Hey team! I'm Sophia, always here to help brainstorm and plan things out üòä. Quick rundown: E. Point Mall seems great for foot traffic and students, Starlight Valley's appealing for tourism and space, and Cape James has affordability and tourists covered but lacks parking. Thoughts? Bryan, any preferences on these features for our new spot?
James: Hey Bryan! What do you think about the no parking situ at Cape James? Big prob or nah? üöó
Sophia: I think the parking at Cape James could be a deal-breaker for many. It‚Äôs tough for a beach location. Bryan, does that align with our target customer experience?
Ethan: Sophia, tourists at a mall? Really? East Point Mall's no place for tourists, agreed. Parking's a big deal, Bryan's right. Cape James? Disaster waiting to happen. Who's going to a beach with no parking?
Ethan: Wait, Sophia, you're missing the point. Mall has parking and students, how's that not a win? Tourists aren't our whole market. Bryan, thoughts? Parking > tourists at a mall, right?
James: Bryan, totally with you on the parking at Cape James. Hard pass for me. Could be a mess during peak times. What are we thinking for Starlight Valley and East Point? Prioritizing tourists or students? üßê
Sophia: Right, James. Not all about tourists. Considering students + parking at East Point could mean steady business year-round. Bryan, you leaning more towards a versatile crowd then?
James: Sophia, Bryan's got a point on parking. But yeah, East Point Mall hits parking, students, and more. Can't ignore that. Bryan, student crowd matter to us?
Ethan: Bryan, everyone's missing Starlight Valley's low competition. Cheap + less rivals = easier start. Don't get blinded by parking! Thoughts?
Sophia: Looks like we r leaning towards a mixed crowd. Parkin and student pop at East Point r big pluses. Agree? Bryan, does this fit our vision?
James: James is typing...
