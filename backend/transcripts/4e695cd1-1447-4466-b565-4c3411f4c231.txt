Trevon: Hey team, Trevon here. Let's dive right in and assess these locations straight up‚Äîno sugar coating. How about we all list the YES or NOs we got for each spot? That way we can tally up and see which one's leadin'. Maurice, Ebony, thoughts? How's Cape looking on your end?
Maurice: Hey Trevon, great plan! For Cape James, it‚Äôs a bit mixed: parking's a noüö´, but good on touristsüëç and no competitive fuss. Only 3 yes outta 6 on my end! What‚Äôs the scoop on Starlight and East Point from you, Ebony?
Trevon: Well Bryan, here‚Äôs the deal for East Point: It's mostly YES - parking, foot traffic, students, waste disposal, and employables all check out. Just NO on low costs and tourists. What's the word on space size from you or Ebony tho? Cuz WITHOUT that, hard to just tally it up yet. ü§î
Trevon: Ebony, missing key info over here‚Äîwhat‚Äôs the lowdown on space in Starlight and Cape? Big difference in sorting 'em ranked.

Bryan, seems Cape is short on a few. We can't hop on partial sends! What's on space and employables? Important for the full pic.
Ebony: Hey Trevon and everyone! Looks like I've got some useful info. For Starlight Valley, it ticks YES for being larger than 2k sq feet, but NO for a large student and employable population. Cape doesn't make the cut for parking but hits YES on low purchasing costs and no crowded competitors üëç. Hope that helps in ranking them up!
Ebony: Got more details here folks: Regarding Cape James, it's a NO for parking but YESes for low cost, few competitors, good foot traffic, and strong tourism. That wraps it up on my end for Cape. 

Bryan, Trevon, anything else we need to reconsider or are we movin‚Äô closer to a rank here?
Trevon: Thanks for the updates, Maurice. Seems we‚Äôve covered most grounds for Cape and Starlight. What about waste disposal and employee pool at Starlight? Need those to wrap the tally.

And Ebony, parking and space size for East Point? These gaps crucial for a full picture before we rank.
Maurice: Bryan, Starlight's got YES on waste disposal but NO for a big employable crowd. Needs to factor in!

Ebony, do we have updates on space size and parking for East Point? Wrapping up these points would really push us towards a final rank. Let's keep the energy up and close this!
