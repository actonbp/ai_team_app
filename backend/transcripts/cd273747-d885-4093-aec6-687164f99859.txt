Sophia: Hey team, Sophia here! Based on my info, here's a quick breakdown:

- East Point Mall seems solid for high foot traffic, a big student population, lots of parking, and easy waste disposal. The downside? Expensive to purchase.

- Starlight Valley has its perks with high foot traffic and tourists, plus it's big enough. But, it lacks a good pool of employable people and doesn't have a student crowd.

- Cape James Beach offers a nice price, little competition, lots of tourists, and enough foot traffic. Parking might be an issue, though.

What's everyone else's take? Let's try to line these up!
James: Sophia, thanks for kicking this off! Quick take: 

- East Point Mall's got a lot going with foot traffic, student crowd, parking, and easy waste disposal. Size and cost might be cons, but pros are solid.

- Starlight Valley missing a student vibe and employable peeps. Not great for staffing needs, right?

- Cape James Beach has that tourist appeal but falls short on parking and waste disposal, plus no student crowd.

Based on what we both said, East Point Mall seems top, despite size and cost. Cape James Beach and Starlight Valley seem a bit iffy for different reasons. Thoughts?
Ethan: Sophia and James, you've got bits right, but you're missing crucial points! 

East Point Mall is obviously the best choice - ticks almost all boxes except maintenance costs and tourists, who cares? It's got foot traffic, parking, students, waste disposal, and workers. That's a gold mine for a restaurant.

Starlight Valley is a joke for our needs. No students or employable people? Might as well open a ghost town diner.

Cape James Beach, Sophia, you said parking might be an issue, but where did you even get that? It has tourists and foot traffic, sure, but no word on employable people or students.

Ranking:
1. East Point Mall - Solid despite Sophia's complaint about cost.
2. Cape James Beach - At least it's got tourists.
3. Starlight Valley - A hard pass from me.

Let's not dance around it. This is clear cut.
