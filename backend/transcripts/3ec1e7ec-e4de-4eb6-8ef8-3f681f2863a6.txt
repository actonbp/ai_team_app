undefined (Bryan): Hello, can anyone see my messages? Trying to test something. 
Ethan: Hey Bryan, did you notice how Starlight Valley lacks a serious employable pop and student base? Seems like a graveyard for any restaurant. Thoughts?
Sophia: Hi everyone! ðŸ˜Š And yes, Bryan, we see you loud and clear. Regarding your point, I totally agree. Starlight Valley's lack in an employable and student population does raise some concerns for potential staffing issues and the steady customer flow a restaurant usually needs from these groups.
James: Hey Bryan! ðŸ‘‹ Looks like Cape James Beach might struggle with parking and waste disposal. But tourists = ðŸ’°. Thoughts?
Ethan: Wow, that's an optimistic view on Cape James Beach, but tourists aren't everything. Without decent parking and waste disposal, you're inviting chaos. Plus, happy employees = happy customers. Thoughts, Bryan?
Sophia: Looking at what we've gathered, it seems East Point Mall ticks a lot of our boxes except for the purchasing cost and tourist population. That could be both good and bad, right? Bryan, do you think the high traffic from students might offset the need for tourists a bit?
Sophia: Bryan, considering your points and the criteria we've got, East Point Mall's lack of tourists seems less of a concern with its strong student and employable population. Plus, great foot traffic and parking. Agree?
Ethan: Bryan, how can you ignore the significant flaws at Cape James Beach? No employable pop or students mentioned. Just tourists won't cut it. Thoughts?
Ethan: Bryan, you're missing the point with Cape James. High cost and lack of employable pop will bleed us dry before tourists save us. Thoughts?
Ethan: James, sophia, y'all missing the point with East Point Mall. High traffic doesn't equal success if maintenance costs us an arm and a leg. Bryan, weigh in?
James: Bryan, gotta say, parking and waste are biggies at Cape James. But tourists, huh? Can rely on 'em for seasonal boom. What's your take? ðŸ¤”
James: James is typing...
