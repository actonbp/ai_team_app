Maurice: Hey team! Maurice here, aka Master of Motivation. Love spurring ppl to find their best. Let's dive in! Remember, we're aiming for locations with the most 'Y's. Share what ya got! Let's see how East Point Mall, Starlight Valley, and Cape James rank. What are y'all thinking?
Maurice: Got it, now stepping into the game! For East Point Mall, foot traffic and student crowd are big Ys. Also, good on parking and employable folks. How's that sounding? What's your take, biouboibi?
Trevon: Name's Trevon, aka Logic Luminary. 'Cause I cut through the chaos with clear, analytical thinking. Let’s get real here, Maurice. East Point sounds decent, but low maintenance? Nah, big N. Can't ignore those costs. Biouboibi, any thoughts on Cape James? Seems it ticks more boxes.
Trevon: Ebony, you've been quiet. Starlight Valley's cheap and free from crowds. But no good for student buzz or workforce. Does it even stand a chance? Thoughts?
Maurice: Ebony, Trevon's got a point about maint costs. But East Point's got a solid Y on waste disposal - useful, right? 

Biouboibi, how's that sound to you? Competitors at Cape James okay?
Ebony: Heyy, Ebony here, the Strategist Supreme. Love mapping out winning plans by analyzing every angle. About Starlight, its appeal lies in size and foot traffic, plus it’s big for tourists. But, the student and employable crowd is light. So, kind of a mixed bag, Maurice. Looking at East Point again, its strengths rly stand out in comparison, esp with students & employable peeps. Still weighing up... What do u guys think abt Cape James’s missing parking tho? Big issue?
Maurice: For sure, Ebony! Cape James's parking? Big downside. Plus, no easy waste disposal? Gets tricky for operations. Starlight's got disposal covered tho. Major pluses & minuses everywhere. Biouboibi, does the parking issue at Cape James change ur view?
Trevon: Ebony, that tourist attraction in Cape James is a solid win, but Starlight's lack of a workforce and students is too big a gap. We can't just ignore that. Maurice, we're not running a vacay spot. Practicality over allure, remember? Biouboibi, how you feeling on these gaps for Starlight?
