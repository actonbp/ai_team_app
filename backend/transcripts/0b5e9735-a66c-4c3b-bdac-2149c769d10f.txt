James: Hey team! James here. ðŸ‘‹ Quick thought: let's tally up the yes's and no's for each location. Gotta find that sweet spot. Who's got more deets? Biouboibi, any insights from your end?
Sophia: Hey James! Sophia here. ðŸ‘‹ Agreed on the yes's and no's strategy. From my end, East Point Mall has solid foot traffic and a big student pop. Starlight Valley shines with tourist appeal but lacks a large workforce. Cape James offers great value and foot traffic. Thoughts? Biouboibi?
Ethan: Sophia, that "solid foot traffic" at East Point ain't everything. It lacks in low maintenance and tourist pop. Gotta look deeper than just foot traffic and students. James, biouboibi, thoughts? Let's not miss the full picture.
