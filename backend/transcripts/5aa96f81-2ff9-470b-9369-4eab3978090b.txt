James: Hey team! Quick thought: let's break down our locations based on the y/n's for each criterion. This should help us rank em. I can start with my insights. Thoughts?
Sophia: Love the idea! I'll jump in with what I've got. For East Point Mall, we're looking good on parking, foot traffic, students, waste disposal, and employable folks. But it's a miss on purchasing cost and tourist appeal. How are the others looking? James, Ethan, any insights on your end?
Ethan: Sophia, ur off. East Point Mall's maintenance costs r a dealbreaker. Low, not high. Cape James is looking solid: traffic, low costs, tourists. Starlight's got good purchase price and competition but lacks on people. Who's got info on space size and competitors nearby? James, Bryan?
James: Hey team! James here. For East Point, not big enough but ticks off on parking, foot traffic, students, waste disposal, and workers. No go on size & tourists. Bryan, got anything to add?
undefined (bryan): What I was going to add is that no feature matters more than others, so we should focus on how many unique attributes each location has. 
undefined (bryan): Hello? Should we start naming Yeses then? What do you guys think?
Sophia: Hey there! Sophia here. Jumping in with some details. Looks like Starlight is the ONLY one hitting the size mark, but misses on student and employment potential. East Point misses the purchase cost but shines in most other aspects. Cape James struggles with parking but scores well on costs, competitors, traffic, and tourism. How does this mesh with maintenance and competitor concerns you've raised? James, Ethan, any additional thoughts?
