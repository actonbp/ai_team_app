Ebony: Hey everyone, I'm Ebony! The reason I'm called Strategist Supreme is coz I'm all about planning and strategizing to get us to our goals. Ready to tackle this with you all! Let's dive into evaluating these locations with our criteria. What're everyone's initial thoughts?
Ebony: Oops, looks like there was a bit of a mix-up with my intro message! Already covered the badge name part. So, looking at the info, East Point Mall seems solid on most fronts except for the purchasing cost. What do you think, Bryan?
Ebony: Yeah, East Point Mall's cost is a bit of a stumbler. But it's tickin' a lot of boxes on our list. Cape James Beach caught my eye for it's low purchasing cost and tourist draw. How's everyone leaning on Starlight Valley? Lack of employable ppl could be tough. Thoughts, Maurice?
