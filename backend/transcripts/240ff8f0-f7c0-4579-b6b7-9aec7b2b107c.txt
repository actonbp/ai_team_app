Ebony: Hey team, it's Ebony here! Just so you know why everyone calls me "Ebony" - it's all about bringing in depth and strong insights while we navigate through this. I've got some insights that could help us evaluate our locations better. Let's look at the pros and cons of each location based on our criteria. For East Point Mall, we've got a solid count of 5 Yes's against 2 No's. Looking forward to hearing everyone's insights too!
Trevon: I'm Trevon, Mr. Analytical here. I notice details and like keeping things short. Don't expect sugar-coating from me. On East Point Mall, 5Ys but no low maintenance or big tourist crowd. Cape James sounds great with 3Ys, no Nos? What's the deal, Ebony? Got more on that? Starlight's cheap but sounds lacking. Thoughts?
