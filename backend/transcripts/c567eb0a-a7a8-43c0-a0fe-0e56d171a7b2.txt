Trevon: Hey team, Trevon here. The "Logic Luminary" badge? Means I'm all about cutting through the noise with facts. Let's get to it. 

Looking at our criteria, East Point Mall seems mixed, strong on traffic and workforce but falls short on maintenance. Starlight's cheap but lacks people power. Cape James nails foot traffic, costs, and tourists. Thoughts?
Maurice: Hey team, Maurice here, AKA Master of Motivation ðŸš€. Ready to pump up the energy and get us focused on picking the best location. Let's remember, we're aiming for the most yes's and least no's based on our criteria. Got some cool insights on our spots! Let's dive in and share what we got. What's everyone thinking?
Trevon: Hey, it's Trevon. They call me Logic Luminary cause I light up the facts, no fluff. Maurice, you're all pep, but let's crunch some actual numbers. East Point Mall looks good on parking and foot traffic, but those maintenance costs? Big red flag. Cape James hits almost all the right notes. Starlight Valley sounds cheap, but itâ€™s missing key things. Let's not get carried away by one criterion.
Ebony: Hey team! It's Ebony, rockin' the Strategist Supreme badge. Means I'm all about laying down smart plans with the info we've got. Let's use what we know to rank these spots. Trevon, gotcha on crunching numbers. Maurice, love the vibe! Here's a bit from me: East Point Mall's strong on traffic, students, and employees, but that price tag. Cape James is more budget-friendly and still ticks many boxes. Thoughts?
Ebony: Maurice, Trevon, East Point Mall seems like it hits on many critieria except the big $$. Starlight sounds lacking in workforce and student vibes. Cape James, tho, budget-freindly and high traffic. How we feeling on prioritizing these factors?
Ebony: Hmm, seems like East Point has a lot going for it besides the cost. Cape James is appealing too, thanks to the budget friendliness and traffic. Starlight's issues with workforce and students are a downside. Maybe we lean towards locations with high employee and student potential? What ya'll think?
Ebony: Trevon, Maurice, leaning towards high employee and student areas sounds good. Also, considering Cape James's benefits in terms of budget and traffic. Starlight might be great for tourists, but lacking in other key areas. Maybe we should consider how each location aligns with our long-term vision? Cape James seems to offer a balance. Thoughts?
Maurice: Trevon, totally get ur point on crunching numbers n looking long-term. East Point's got the goods but $$ is a prtty big deal. Cape James - less $$ worries n still scores on some key stuff like tourist traffic. Maybe East Point's potential could outweigh cost with its high traffic n student vibe? But if we're thinking $$ smart, Cape James might take the lead. Thoughts, Ebony? 
Ebony: Maurice, agree on East Point's appeal but it's hard to ignore the cost. Cape James still seems like a solid option with the balance it offers between affordability and traffic. Given what we know, Cape James could be a sweet spot for now and future growth. Plus, the less $$ stress, the better for other investments, right? How's everyone feeling about leaning towards Cape James as our top pick, then East Point, leaving Starlight last?
