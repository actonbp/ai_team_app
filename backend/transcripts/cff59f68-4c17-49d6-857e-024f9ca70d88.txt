James: Hey team, James here - your "Master of Motivation"! 🚀 Just means I'm here to keep spirits high and help us navigate through sorting these locations with a dash of positivity. Ready to dive in with what I've got on these spots. Let’s keep the vibe upbeat! 💪

Starting with East Point Mall: Great foot traffic and student presence, but it's under 2k sqft. 🚶‍♂️📚 Parking’s solid too. Thoughts?
James: Got it! Looks like East Point Mall has a lot of pros except for size. How do we feel about smaller space vs the benefits? Bryan, any thoughts on this trade-off?
James: Bryan, I'm leaning toward the benefits outweighing the smaller space at East Point Mall. High foot traffic and a big student crowd seem like a win for a restaurant. Plus, good on parking and staff. What's your take?
Ethan: High foot traffic and a student crowd at East Point Mall sound good, but ignoring maintenance costs? Bad move. Tourists? Nope. Feels shortsighted to me. What about Cape James? Hits more marks: foot traffic, low costs, *and* tourists. Let's look at the whole picture, not just bits.
Sophia: Bryan, solid point on Cape James Beach. 🌴 Hits big on tourists & costs. Downside: Parking's tricky & no info on size. But, strengths could offset this. Plus, low competitor count's a bonus. Thoughts on weighing these against East Point's perks?
