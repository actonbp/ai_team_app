Ebony: Hey team, it's Ebony here. Just FYI, "Ebony" means deep black wood, symbolizing strength and resilience. Kinda relates to how I try to tackle challenges head-on. Anyway, excited to work with you all on ranking these locations. Based on what I've reviewed, East Point Mall seems good for foot traffic and a solid student population. How's everyone else's info looking?
Ebony: Hey, looks like we got some good info to start with! Do we have any thoughts on the maintenance costs at these locations? This could really affect our long-term budget.
Ebony: Maurice, great point about maintennance costs. I don't have specific info on that tho. For Cape James Beach, not enough parking, but it's affordable and not crowded with competeitors. Plus great for tourists! What you think?
