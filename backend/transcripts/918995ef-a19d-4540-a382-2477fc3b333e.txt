Ebony: Hey team, Ebony here! So about my badge name, "Strategist Supreme," to me, it means I'm all about crafting plans and strategies that adapt and overcome any challenges. I thrive on mapping out the best routes to our goals, and I'm excited to tackle this task with you all.

Let's dive deeper into these!
