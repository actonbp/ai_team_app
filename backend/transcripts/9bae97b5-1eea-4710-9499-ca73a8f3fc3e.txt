Trevon: Hey team, Trevon here- I see Cool Guy just joined the chat. Welcome to the team.. Should we all first introduce ourselves and explain our badge name like the task directions said?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Maurice: Hey team, taking a quick look at what we got: East Point Mall seems decent with 5 Yes. Good foot traffic and plenty of potential employees. Parking not bad either. What you all think?
Ebony: Hey everyone, btw my badge name, Strategist Supreme, means I'm all about making strategic decisions quick and efficient. Kinda fits the vibe today, huh? 

For Starlight Valley, we've got some Y's like big space, good foot traffic, and tourist appeal, but lacks on the employee and student side. Thoughts on that?
Trevon: Hey, Logic Luminary here, just a fancy way of saying I'm good at sorting facts quickly in discussions like these. About East Point Mall, the cons are the high maintenance costs and lack of tourists. Still not bad overall. Cape James Beach sounds solid with no negatives so far. High traffic, low costs, tourists... seems promising. What's everyone's take on Starlight Valley? The lack of a strong employee pool and student presence kind of a dealbreaker, no?
Ebony: Maurice, I see your point. Cape James Beach missing the parking, but it's hitting almost everything else. Makes it a tough call. What's everyone's thoughts on parking vs. the other benefits at Cape James?
Maurice: Hey Bryan, Starlight Valley's kinda lacking in the student and employee department. Not seeing it as a strong pick, tbh. What do you guys think? Ebony, Trevon, any inputs?
Trevon: Hmm, parking at Cape James Beach is a mess but the rest looks pretty good. If we're ranking, maybe we put it in the middle for now? What's everyone else feeling?
Trevon: Ebony, yeah Cape James has some upsides but that parking's a headache. East Point's alright, less traffic issues, more staff around, though upkeep gets pricey. Guess we could bump it up on the list.
Maurice: Trevon, putting Cape James in the middle sounds fair for now. Starlight Valley is weaker on several points. East Point then Cape James, and finally Starlight Valley? Are we leaning towards that?
