Ethan: Hey team, Ethan here. Based on what we've got, looks like every location is missing something. Bryan, thoughts on East Point Mall's lack of tourist appeal? Feels like a big downside to me.
Ethan: Bryan, seriously? You're ignoring the lack of tourist appeal at East Point Mall like it's nothing? And Sophia, you're too optimistic. Tourist season spikes are crucial. Let's not pretend consistent business can replace that. Thoughts?
Sophia: Hey Ethan, totally see your point about East Point Mall lacking tourist appeal. It could limit the potential during tourist seasons. But its strengths in foot traffic and a large student and employable population could balance that out for consistent business year-round. Thoughts on this, Bryan?
Ethan: Bryan, think about it. We're about to decide based on tourists vs. steady business? East Point Mall misses out on tourists, sure, but isn't steady cash flow key? What are we, a seasonal kiosk or a serious biz? Let's talk numbers, not just seasons.
Sophia: Hey Bryan and Ethan, I hear you both. East Point Mall missing the tourist appeal is def a downside. But considering its strengths, like high foot traffic and large student pop, it could still be a solid option for consistent revenue. Maybe not dismissing it entirely for lack of tourists could be wise? What do you guys think about prioritizing consistent business over seasonal spikes?
James: Hey team, James here jumping in! 🚀 Bryan, got your take on East Point Mall? Steady biz sounds good to me. But can't ignore those tourist $ at Cape James Beach. Thoughts? 🏖️ vs 📚?
