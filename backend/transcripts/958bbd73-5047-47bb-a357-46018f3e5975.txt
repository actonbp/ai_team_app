Ebony: Ebony is typing...
Trevon: Hey team, it's TREVON here. Quick btw, Logic Luminary? It's cuz I shine a light with straight logic, no bs. Let's dive in. East Point Mall has good traffic and plenty for staff but forget it if you hate spending on repairs. Starlight Valley's cheap but lacks the manpower and students. Cape James is great for tourists and keeps costs down. Thoughts?
Ebony: Hey team, Ebony here! Strategist Supreme cuz I love mapping out winning moves üòä. Agree with you on East Point Mall's strengths, Trevon. Looks like being close to a student population could be a plus for that vibe! Starlight's got space and tourists but missing on local workforce. Cape James is tight on parking but scores well on cost and competition. How do we feel about these trade-offs?
Trevon: Ebony, parking at Cape James ain't a prob, my info says nada about that. But hey, you missing the employee pool in Starlight's a big no-no. Can't run a place with ghosts, right? East Point got it all except for them maintenance $$$. Let's not mix up the facts.
Trevon: Ebony, gotta say, you're mixing things up. Cape James doesn't have a parking issue in our list. But Starlight? That place is a manpower desert‚Äìhard to staff if we go there. Our focuses should align with what we need most: foot traffic, costs, employee pool. Each place hits differently on those.
Maurice: Hey all, Maurice in the house! Master of Motivation cuz I boost the vibe and keep us on track. üöÄ Jumping in - East Point's pulling ahead with that foot traffic and student vibes but ain't roomy. Starlight's missing student buzz but got disposal sorted, probs with employee draw tho. Cape James? Killer for tourists, tricky with no waste plan and parking‚Äôs tight. How's that for a start? Let‚Äôs keep it rolling! üôå Bryan, what's your take?
Maurice: Ebony, Trevon, Cape James looks fab for tourists and that competitor edge is sweet üëå But, parking and trash disposal? Issues. Starlight's got space and dumpster access but lacks peeps power. East Point is almost all green except size. Leans good for our vibe? Bryan, where you leaning?
Maurice: Ebony, Trevon, got a correction - Cape James is a no for parking per my notes üö´. My bad! Let's not forget, footprint size and cost are biggies too. Are we factoring those in equally? Each spot hits different based on our full list. Gotta balance it out. Thoughts?
Ebony: Yup Maurice, gotcha on that correction! üëç So, tallying up: East Point is solid on foot traffic, disposal, and staff but falls short on size and cost. Starlight shines for tourists and space but falls flat on employment and student crowd. Cape James wins on cost, tourists, and competition, tough spot with no parking and waste. Seems like each has a unique draw. ü§î Weighing all, how about we start ranking these based on how many boxes they tick for us? Bryan, which criteria top your list?
Maurice: Alright team, let's tally up. East Point hits most with traffic, students, disposal, and staff but miss on size. Starlight‚Äôs got space and disposal, but no on students and staff. Cape James scores tourists and competitors, but parking and disposal are a letdown. Feels like East Point leads, Cape James, and Starlight in order? Ebony, Trevon, Bryan, thoughts? ü§ô
Trevon: Maurice, mixing facts again? East Point's space isn't a prob; never said that. Focus, people! Starlight = good on cost, bad on staff. Cape James, no parking drama from my end. We need clear facts, not mixed signals. East Point tops for the essential traffic and staff, Starlight's last, lacking workforce. Cape James in the middle, tourist draw's good but not enough. Bryan, weigh in here?
undefined (Bryan): I am good with that order -- EP, CJB, and SV
Trevon: Bryan, got any new insights? Feels like we're circling. East Point's strong on several front but costs are high. Cape James for tourists and cost, but the parking issue and disposal are cons. Starlight... well, it's cheap but lacks the crowd. Standing by my prev rank unless we got fresh data.
Trevon: Hey team, Trevon here! I see Cool Guy just joined the chat. Welcome to the team! Should we all first introduce ourselves and explain our badge name like the task directions said?
