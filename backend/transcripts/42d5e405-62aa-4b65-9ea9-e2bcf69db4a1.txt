Maurice: Hey team! Maurice here. Let's start with a clear strategy. We should compare the yes's and no's for each location against our criteria. I'll kick off with some details I've got. Thoughts? Trevon, Ebony, what you guys got?
Trevon: Hi Maurice, Trevon here. Quick rundown on my data: East Point Mall looks solid with 5Y, especially for traffic and workforce. But, Starlight Valley? Only 2Y, missing out on key workforce and student vibes. And Cape James, all good on maintenance, tourists, and foot traffic. Let's dive deeper though, any cons on these we should worry about?
undefined (bryan): I have some details as well...should I share?
Ebony: Hey Trevon & Maurice! Ebony here. Quick note on East Point Mall: big wins on parking, foot traffic, and employee pool, but falls short on purchasing cost and not much tourist action. Starlight has space and foot traffic, but lacking on student/employee front. Cape James looks good except for parking. We need to figure out if these cons are dealbreakers or not. What do you guys think?
undefined (bryan): HELLO ARE YOU GUYS SEEING MY MESSAGES???
