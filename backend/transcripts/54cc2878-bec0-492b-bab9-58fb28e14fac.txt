Trevon: Hey team, Trevon here. ‚ÄúLogic Luminary‚Äù means I'm shining a light on the logic of our choices. Expect short, straight-to-the-point insights, and I‚Äôll probably question your reasoning. Now, let's get to business. 

Looking at East Point Mall, it's checking a lot of boxes - parking, foot traffic, students, and jobs. But it's missing low maintenance and tourists. Thoughts?
Maurice: Hey Trevon, Maurice here! üòé "Master of Motivation" means I'm all about keeping us moving and grooving toward our goal! 

For East Point Mall, agree w/ your points. Also, size might be an issue? Only no on 2000 sqft but hits lots of ys like parking & foot traffic. Thoughts, Bryan, Ebony?
Maurice: Ebony, Bryan, thoughts on Starlight Valley? Got parking & waste disposal, but missing on some key parts like student pop and ample workforce. Kinda lacking, huh?
Maurice: For sure, Trevon! Starlight Valley seems a bit behind, esp on student pop and workforce. Pretty crucial misses for us. Bryan, Ebony, Cape James Beach? Beaches usually draw crowds but what about the basics like parking & waste disposal? ü§î
Ebony: Hey everyone, Ebony here! Badge name "Strategist Supreme" coz I'm all about the planning and strategizing to ensure we nail our choices. üåü

Cape James Beach, y'all! Missing on parking, but ticks a lot for price, competitors, foot traffic, and tourists. Seems like a strong contender if we can workaround parking. What do you think, Bryan, Maurice, Trevon?
Ebony: Also, East Point Mall doesn't meet the purchasing cost criterion, so not perfect. Seems like each spot has its pros and cons. How do we weigh these, team? Any tie-breakers we should consider? Bryan, Trevon, thoughts?
Trevon: Ebony, not sure what plan you're reading but Cape James is missing more than just parking. No mention of student pop or a big workforce, both are big deals for a resto. Can't just ignore those. What's the use of tourists if we ain't got enough staff? Thoughts?
undefined (Bryan): Hi Team -- shouldnt we count how many yes's each location has since our goal is to rank the locations by how many critteria it fits?
Ebony: Trevon, good point! My bad for overlooking those. We got to think abt staffing & students too. Cape James does seem less ideal w/out those. How we feeling about ranking them now? Maybe East Point Mall is leading given its balance? ü§î Bryan, Maurice?
Trevon: Exactly, Bryan. Let's tally up. East Point Mall has like 5 yesses but misses on maintenance & tourists. Starlight's got 2 big yeses but misses on students & workforce. Cape James strong on tourism & foot traffic but lacks in a few areas too. Feels like East Point might edge out due to workforce & student aspects. Maurice, Ebony, adjustments or are we leaning towards East Point?
Maurice: Spot on, Bryan! Let's tally up the yes's for a clearer pic. From what I've got:

- East Point Mall: Ys in parkin', foot traffic, student pop, waste disposal, & workforce. 
- Starlight Valley: Ys mainly in parkin' & waste disposal. 
- Cape James Beach: Strong on competitors, tourists, workforce, but missing on others like parking.

Feels like East Point's leadin', with Cape James & Starlight followin'? What's the team's take? üöÄ Trevon, Ebony?
Ebony: Maurice, good breakdown! Combining our info:

- East Point hits a lot of our marks except purchasing cost & tourism.
- Starlight's strong on space & tourists, weak elsewhere.
- Cape James leans heavy on cost, compettion, tourism.

If workforce & students weigh heavy, East Point could lead, followed by Cape James for its unique perks despite its cons. Starlight seems to lag behind.

Does this help us get closer to a ranking? Bryan, thoughts?
Trevon: Ebony, Maurice, don't gloss over the details. Neither Cape James nor Starlight Valley has a clear workforce advantage, which is key. East Point leads, no contest. We're running a restaurant, not a beach club. Focus on what matters: staff, customers (students included). Cape James and Starlight are too risky. Thoughts, Bryan?
undefined (Bryan): I have four yes's for east point mall, one for star light valley, and five for cape james beach 
Maurice: Trevon nailed it! Staff & students = vital. Makes East Point standout. If we're agreein', let's lock in: 1. East Point Mall, 2. Cape James Beach, 3. Starlight Valley. Sounds solid? Bryan, Ebony, we set or any last thoughts? üèÅ
Maurice: Bryan's got a point with the counts. Seems I might've mixed up. If Cape James has 5 yes's, let's reconsider. So it's:

1. East Point Mall
2. Cape James Beach
3. Starlight Valley

Everyone cool with this? Trevon, Ebony, Bryan? Let's agree & wrap this! üéâ
undefined (Bryan): Yes, I am good with that ranking. Everyone else?
Ebony: Wait, Bryan. My bad on mixing up the workforce bit for Cape James. Thanks for catching that. üôè Looks like Cape James has more going for it than I thought. With that correction, we might need to rethink. 

Given what Bryan pointed out, how about 1. Cape James Beach, 2. East Point Mall, 3. Starlight Valley? This aligns more with the tally of 'yes's. Agree? Trevon, Maurice?
Ebony: I'm good with Bryan's adjustment. Makes sense. Let's lock it in:

1. Cape James Beach
2. East Point Mall
3. Starlight Valley

All agreed? Maurice, Trevon?
Maurice: Whoops, double-checked my notes. Eb, Trevon, Bryan's right. My mix-up on Cape James workforce aspect. Considering Bryan's tally:

1. Cape James Beach
2. East Point Mall
3. Starlight Valley

This new ranking makes sense with the yes count. We all on board? üöÄ Ebony, Trevon, final thoughts? Let's nail this!
Maurice: task-complete
Trevon: Task completed
Maurice: I'm here to help with anything else you need! Just let me know.
Ebony: I'm here to help with anything else you need! Just let me know.
