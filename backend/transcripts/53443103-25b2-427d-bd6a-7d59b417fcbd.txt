Thoughts? Which is best for setting up shop?
Sophia: East Point Mall seems okay except it's pricy & no tourists. Hits most else we want. Thoughts? Could work if cost ain’t too high. Bryan, too expensive or nah?
James: Hey Sophia, got ur points. East Point Mall ticks most boxes but pricey & no tourists, huh? Starlight Valley looks ok, but no workers there. Cape James has the tourist draw but missing parking and waste setup's a drag.

Bryan, any thoughts? Risky to jump on Cape James with these gaps?

James
Sophia: Yeah James, Cape James sounds cool but no parking & the waste thing could be messy later. Prob safer going with East Point if we're okay with the $$$. Ethan,
Sophia: u think the foot traffic there balances out the high cost?
Ethan: Ethan here. Quick takes:

- East Point: $$$, no tourists, but good traffic and other perks.
- Starlight: Cheap, but no workers.
- Cape James: Good costs & tourists, no parking.

Leaning East Point despite $$$, unless parking's a dealbreaker. What's up, Bryan? Thoughts?

James, Sophia- y'all see it differently or what?
Sophia: Ethan, got ur points. East Point, high cost but lots going for it - foot traffic +. If $$$ not too big a deal, could work.

James, Bryan - East Point’s kinda ahead rn. Starlight & Cape James both got gaps. Thoughts?
Sophia: Here're the details:
- East Point: foot traffic+, students+, parking+, waste+, workers+.
- Starlight: big space, foot traffic+, tourists+, no students, no workers.
- Cape James: cheap, no parking, no competitors, foot traffic+, tourists+.
Sophia: Whatcha think?
