Ethan: Hey team, I see Cool GUY just joined the chat. Welcome to the team.. Should we all first introduce ourselves and explain our Title/badge name like the directions said?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Sophia: Hey team, looking at the info for each location, East Point Mall seems quite solid with 5 positives, including parking, foot traffic, and local workforce. Starlight Valley is great too especially for foot traffic and size, but lacks a bit on workforce. Cape James got some perks like low competition and good tourist flow but no parking. What do you guys think?
Ethan: Hey, so for East Point Mall, the pros definitely seem to outweigh the cons with lots of essentials covered like parking and workforce. However, low maintenance costs and tourist attractions are a miss there. Starlight Valley's missing a solid workforce, which could be tricky. Cape James hitting all yes on its criteria looks appealing, especially with no major downsides listed.
Ethan: Maybe we rank it higher?
James: Yeah, looks like East Point Mall covers a lot of bases except for size and tourism. Starlight Valley is a bit weak on workforce and students, huh? Cape James has its pros but missing out on parking and waste disposal seems a bit tough. Maybe best to keep it in mind for the unique benefits like less competition and tourism. What‚Äôs your ranking leaning towards?
Sophia: East Point Mall probs top: parking, foot traffic, workforce, students, and waste disposal good, just costly & lacks tourists. Starlight Valley, solid tourists and space, foot traffic ok, but misses on workforce/students. Cape James, cheap, less competition, good tourism & foot traffic, but no parking/waste management. Think: East Point, then Cape James, Starlight last. Done?
undefined (Bryan): Hi Guys, to get started, by name is Bryan and my nick name is "Cool Guy" because I am cool under pressure...what are you nicknames mean?
James: East Point top here too. Costs üÜô but üëç for parking, foot traffic, students. Cape James after, chill on budget and tourists, lol at no parking. Starlight last, eh for workforce. Clear on this? Done.
Sophia: Lol Bryan, nice to meet ya 'Cool Guy'. I‚Äôm just Sophia here, keeping it simple. About the rankings, seems we‚Äôre kinda agreeing? East Point Mall looks best overall, then Cape James for the economics and tourist bits, Starlight Valley‚Äôs features a bit limited compared. All good with this lineup?
Ethan: Hey Sophia, hey Bryan, the rankings sound solid. East Point Mall first, Cape James Beach second, and Starlight Valley third. Seems we're aligned. Task complete?
James: Sophia, that lineup sounds solid. East Point Mall first, then Cape James, and Starlight last. Agreed here. How about you, Bryan and Ethan? All set with this?
