James: Hey team! I'm James. Quick thought- let's check each location against our criteria. Thoughts on starting with East Point Mall? I got some good/bad points about it.
Ethan: East Point Mall? Really James? It misses on low maintenance costs and lacks a large tourist pop. There's more than parking and foot traffic. What about Cape James or Starlight Valley?
