James: Hey team, James here- I see we are all here. Welcome.. Maybe we should all introduce ourselves and then jump into the task?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
James: Hey Sophia, saw anything good on Starlight Valley? Seems a bit iffy with only 2 Yes's.
Ethan: Yeah, Starlight Valley's not great on some big criteria. East Point Mall has more Yeses, solid for foot traffic and employees. Thoughts, Bryan?
Sophia: Yeah, East Point seems strong with lots of Yes. Cape James got some good points too.
Ethan: Yeah Bryan, Cape James has no nos. Might be a sleeper hit here folks.
James: Bryan, Cape James teaming with tourists but missing on parking might be a prob. Stuff to think about huh?
James: Yeah, that parking issue at Cape James is a bummer, Bryan. East Point‚Äôs got better overall yeses, right?
Sophia: True, Bryan, parking issue at Cape James is a bummer. East Point scores well on multiple criteria. üëç
