Trevon: Hey team, I see we are all here. Welcome.. Maybe we should all introduce ourselves and then jump into the task like the directions said?BTW, u click the raise hand button to bring up the chat box..
Maurice: Hey everyone, Maurice here. Just looking at East Point Mall, seems decent with parking, decent foot traffic, and solid workforce access. Misses on size >2000 sqft and tourists tho ðŸ¤” Thoughts?
Trevon: Hey Maurice, Trevon here. EPM also has quick access for waste disposal on top, so might be a stronger contender than it looks. What's the deal with tourist crowd tho, got any info on that?
undefined (Bryan): Hi guys, I think I am a leader in this group! 
Maurice: hey Bryan, cool cool. so about East Point Mall, no big tourist crowd there but ticks other boxes. gotta weight pros n cons, ya know? 
Ebony: Hey all, Ebony here. Maurice, Trevon, bout East Point Mall, they def got parking, students & foot traffic nailed. But yeah, not the spot for tourists. Also, buying cost ainâ€™t under 1MM. Might impact the budget.
Trevon: Makes sense, Ebony. With EPM, we're trading off cost and tourists for other benefits. Not easy pick!
Maurice: got it, anyone took a look at Starlight Valley or Cape James Beach details yet? how they stacking up?
Trevon: Cape James Beach looks solid yâ€™all. Good foot traffic, low costs, plus tourists. Seems good on a lot of fronts. How about competitors around there? Any insights?
