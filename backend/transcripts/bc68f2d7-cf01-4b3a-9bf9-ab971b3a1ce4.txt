Ethan: Ethan here, the "Cruncher." I'm all about the numbers. Short, sweet, sometimes salty. 😏

Sophia, James, that size issue at East Point Mall is bad, but so's ignoring cost at Starlight and Cape James. Bryan?
Sophia: Hey James! Sophia here. My badge name suits coz I hv a knack for detailed plans, making sure we don't miss the small stuff while keeping things short & sweet. 😊

About East Point Mall, the foot traffic and student pop sound great, but that purchasing cost might be a dealbreaker. Thoughts, Bryan?
James: Hey team! James here, the go-to guy for quick answers and a bit of cheer! 😎 Let's dive into those locations. Bryan, have u picked a badge name yet? Let's get this party started! 

Looking at the list, seems we’ve got a real mix. Thoughts on East Point Mall being a target, given its lack of size but good foot traffic and student pop? 🤔
James: Bryan, got a badge name yet? We're all ears!

East Point Mall’s size is a downer. But those students & foot traffic are hard to beat. Can we overlook the size, or is space a must? 🤷‍♂️
Sophia: Hey there, I'm Sophia, the "Detail Diver." I love diving deep into the details to make sure we've got everything covered!

Bryan, we're curious about your badge name. Got one picked out yet?

Regarding East Point Mall, its size is a concern, but can't ignore that foot traffic and student pop. Maybe we can be creative with the space? What ya think? 🤔
Ethan: Ethan here. Cruncher's the name cuz I break down the numbers, sometimes skulls (joking... or am I?). 

Bryan, where's that badge name at? Keeping us in suspense, huh?

James, you're missing the point on East Point. Size? We can adjust. But no tourists and high maintenance? That's a dumpster fire waiting to happen. Starlight's got the cost and competition angle covered, but who's gonna work there with no employable pop?

Cape James is all smiles with tourists and low costs. Could be the jackpot. What's everyone missing here? Thoughts?
Ethan: No name? That's classic Bryan. 🙄

Listen up, we're missing the big picture with East Point. Sure, it's got foot traffic and students, but no tourists? High maintenance? C'mon.

Sophia, love the detail 'dive,' but we can't polish a turd. Cape James is our gold mine. Tourists, low costs, but oh wait, NO PARKING. Great planning.

Starlight's cheap but empty. Who's gonna work there, ghosts?

Ethan, signing off. 🎤
Sophia: Hey team, Sophia here, aka the "Detail Diver" 🐬 a badge name coz I love getting into the gritty details of things, ensuring we don't miss a beat while keeping it brief!

Ethan, you have a point about East Point's challenges. Cape James, despite its parking and space issues, sounds promising with its tourist appeal and low costs. Maybe we can manage parking creatively? What's everyone's take?
James: Hey Bryan! Still waiting on that badge name 😄. Gotta say, Ethan's making good points.

But let's not toss East Point yet. Maybe we can be creative with the space? Starlight's meh on staff options. Cape James lacks parking & waste disposal 😬. Hard to pick. What do you think, Bryan? Any favs?
