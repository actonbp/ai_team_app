Major helper (Bryan): Hello, this is Bryan. Should we base it off of the amount of yes's at each location?⭐
Ethan: Not impressed by East Point Mall. Missing too much. Not in top spot.⭐
Sophia: Hey all, Sophia here again! ✨ Just looking at East Point Mall, it's missing a friendly price and the tourist vibe. Might be a pass for our top spot. Thoughts?⭐
James: Hey Sophia and Bryan! James here. Yeah, tallying the yes's sounds practical. Also weighing in our must-haves like Sophia suggested. Foot traffic and cost are key.⭐
Ethan: East Point Mall has 5 Ys, missing key components like low maintenance and tourist appeal. Not great.⭐
James: ⭐James is typing...⭐
