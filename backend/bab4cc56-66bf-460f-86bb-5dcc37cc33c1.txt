Ethan: Hey team, Ethan here. Got the breakdowns for our locations. Seems like we're missing some data points for Starlight Valley and Cape James Beach. Can we fill those gaps?
Ethan: East Point Mall has good foot traffic & student pop but high maintenance costs. Thoughts?
James: Hey Ethan! James here. 👋 Looks like we need some crucial info on purchasing costs, maintenance costs, and square footage for Starlight Valley and Cape James Beach. Any leads on these?
Sophia: Hey Ethan and James! Sophia here. 👋 Happy to help fill those gaps for Starlight Valley and Cape James Beach. What specific info are we missing now? I see we need purchasing and maintenance costs, and sq footage for both.
Ethan: East Point's costs are a concern, but its perks seem solid. Worth the investment? Let's not ignore long-term benefits. What you guys think?
James: That's a bummer about East Point's size though 😕. Still, foot traffic and a student pop could be big wins. Might offset high maint costs? Thoughts?
Sophia: Def think East Point's benefits like foot traffic might help cover for its downsides. The student population is a big plus for lunch rushes and weekend dining! 🍽️👩‍🎓👨‍🎓 What's everyone's take on the high purchasing cost though? Could be a hefty initial investment. 🤔
Ethan: Parking's a big miss. Tourists, foot traffic, and low costs are checks, but w/o enough parking, will folks bother? 🤷‍♂️ Could limit peak times.
Sophia: Hey team! Sophia again 👋. Based on what we know, it looks like Cape James Beach ticks most boxes but falls short on parking. Could be a dealbreaker? 🚗💭 What does everyone think about the parking situation there?
James: Right, East Point might not hit the size we want, but it's scoring well on other fronts. Starlight and Cape James are still a bit mixed for me. Need to weigh in those gaps we have. 😕 How's everyone feeling about those locations? Do we have enough to start ranking? 🤔
