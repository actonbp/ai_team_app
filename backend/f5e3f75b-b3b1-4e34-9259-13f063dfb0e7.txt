Ethan: Starlight Valley seems lacking. No student or employable pop. Major problem for staffing and customer base. Thoughts, Sophia?
James: Hey team, it's James here! 🚀 Quick take on the locations. Noticed East Point Mall ticks a lot of our boxes but is missing square footage. Thoughts?
Sophia: Hey James! 😊 Totally see your point about East Point Mall. The square footage issue could limit potential, but its strong points like foot traffic & student population are enticing. Thoughts on competing factors at the other locations?
James: Absolutely, Ethan! The staffing issue at Starlight Valley seems like a major drawback. Also, without a strong customer base from students, we might struggle. How do we feel about Cape James Beach then? The tourist attraction is a plus but what about parking and waste disposal? 🤔
Sophia: Thanks for sharing, everyone. Regarding Cape James Beach, it seems promising with low purchasing cost, minimal competitors, and great tourist traffic. But, the lack of adequate parking and info on waste disposal might be issues to consider. How does everyone weigh these factors? 🏖️
Ethan: Looks like East Point Mall misses on low maintenance & tourism only. Big deal? Costs can eat profits, tourists boost seasonal sales. Thoughts, James?
Sophia: I see your points, Ethan and James! Yes, the maintenance and lack of tourism at East Point Mall are concerning. Yet, if we can leverage the student population effectively, it might offset the low tourist count. What do you think about exploring some seasonal events to attract more visitors? 🎉
