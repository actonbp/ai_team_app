Participant: Hello, this is Bryan. Should we base it off of the amount of yes's at each location?
Ethan: East Point falls short on maintenance and tourists. Big on students and trash though. Not great, not terrible.
James: Hey team! James here. Just took a quick look at our options. Looks like East Point Mall is quite the mixed bag, huh? Missing size but aces in foot traffic, students, and easy waste disposal. Thoughts?
Sophia: Hey James! Sophia here. Totally agree on East Point Mall's mixed results. Seems like it's great for students and foot traffic but might hit us on the budget. How are we feeling about the over $1MM mark? Worth it for the traffic?
Ethan: Cape James looks good. Tourists yes. But waste disposal no. Parking? Not great either. Priorities?
Sophia: So looking at what we've got, Cape James seems like a solid choice for tourists and cost. But parking and employment could be issues. How important is parking for us at a beach location?
James: Hey Bryan! Yeah, tallying the yes's is a solid start. Looks like East Point has the most yes's but missing out on size and tourists. Starlight and Cape James are a toss-up based on what we value more - students or tourists. Thoughts?
Ethan: Parking is crucial. We need it. Especially for families. Not everyone takes public transport.
Sophia: Parking at a beach could swing either way. Nice to have, but maybe not a deal-breaker with good foot traffic and public transport? ðŸ¤”
Ethan: Starlight's cheap but lacks workforce and students. Not viable. Cape and East Point better. Decide what we value more. Parking or tourists+cost. 
Sophia: That's a valid point, Bryan. Families and bigger groups will definitely need the parking. Can't rely solely on foot traffic and public transit. Considering that, East Point might have an edge with the parking situation...
James: So if we line it up, East Point wins on students, waste, and parking, but not size or tourists. Starlight falls short on workforce and students. Cape struggles with parking and waste but shines with tourists. Tough call! ðŸ¤”
Ethan: Parking wins. Tourists won't save us if no one can visit easily. East Point is our best shot. Size we can manage. Cape's waste issue is a no.
James: James is typing...
