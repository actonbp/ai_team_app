Major helper (Bryan): Hello, this is Bryan. Should we base it off of the amount of yes's at each location?
Sophia: Bryan, that's one way to start. Let's compile the yes's for each and see how they stack up. Cape James Beach seems promising on purchase cost and tourism. üèñÔ∏è Thoughts?
Ethan: East Point: 5 Y‚Äôs. Size & costs? Major downsides. 

Starlight: Only 2 Y‚Äôs, but costs and competition are good. 

Cape James: Strong candidate. 4 Y's, but waste disposal? 

Thoughts?
Ethan: Cost's critical, Sophia. East Point Mall fails on maintenance and tourism. Costs add up. Other locations?
Ethan: Cape James has the size. It's touristy, lots of foot traffic, low on maintenance. Size = good, Ethan.
Sophia: Hey team, Sophia here! Just looked over the info. East Point Mall seems strong on foot traffic and parking. Thoughts on importance of purchase cost here?
James: Hey Sophia! James here. Totally, cost is key but so is making sure the spot's big enough for us. East Point Mall's missing that mark on size. üòï
Sophia: Got it, James! Size definitely counts. Looks like East Point is out of the running for that. 

What about Cape James Beach and Starlight Valley on size? Got details?
James: James is typing...
