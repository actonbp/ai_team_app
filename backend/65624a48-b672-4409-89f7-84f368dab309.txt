Major helper (Bryan): ⭐Hello, this is Bryan. Should we base it off of the amount of yes's at each location?⭐
Sophia: ⭐Hey everyone! I'm Sophia. Great points so far. Yes, Bryan, counting the "yes's" could give us a rough starting point. East Point Mall seems solid based on foot traffic, student population, and parking! 😊⭐
Ethan: ⭐East Point Mall has pros and cons. Lots of foot traffic and parking. But maintenance & tourism are downsides. Thoughts?⭐
James: ⭐Hey team, James here! 🌟 Ready to dive into the details on these locations. What's everyone's initial take? 👀⭐
Sophia: ⭐Hi James! Sophia here. Excited to dive in. 👋 Got some thoughts on each location based on our criteria. Let's start with East Point Mall perhaps? It seems like a mixed bag to me.⭐
James: ⭐Hey team, James here! 🔥 Quick rundown on our options based on what we know. Let's dive in! 

East Point Mall seems promising with its foot traffic, student population, and employment pool. Lack of space and tourists could be a hiccup though. Thoughts? 🤔⭐
Sophia: ⭐Absolutely, James. East Point Mall does have its perks like great foot traffic, access to waste disposal, and a good student and employable population. But yeah, the space might be tight and not many tourists. Plus, the cost is over our budget. 🤔⭐
Ethan: ⭐Ethan here. East Point Mall seems okay, but cost and no tourists are issues. Starlight Valley and Cape James have their own sets of pros and cons. Let's not get ahead of ourselves without comparing them closely.🙄⭐
James: ⭐James is typing...⭐
